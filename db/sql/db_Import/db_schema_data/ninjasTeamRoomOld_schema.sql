I<r>ll use examples from computer games you<r>ve probably already played. There are lots of different types of computer games, and I<r>ll talk about how maths is used in some of the following examples:<br/><br/>The First Person Shooter (FPS) is a type of game where you run around 3D levels carrying a big gun shooting stuff. Examples of this sort of game include Doom , Quake , Half Life , Unreal or Goldeneye . There are other games that look very similar, but aren<r>t first person shooters, for instance Zelda: Ocarina of Time or Mario 64 .<br/><br/>The Strategy games are divided into two main types, Real Time Strategy (RTS), and Turn Based Strategy (not usually called TBS for some reason). These games usually involve building and managing a city or civilization and also fighting wars by controlling troops. Examples of real time strategy games are Age of Empires , Command <a>amp;; Conquer , Tiberian Sun . Examples of turn based strategy games are Civilization and Alpha Centauri .<br/><br/>Simulation games are games that try to make something as realistic as possible. For instance, Flight Sims are computer games which try to realistically simulate flying an aeroplane or helicopter. Two games of this sort are Microsoft Flight Simulator and Red Baron . Space sims are like flight sims, but with spaceships instead of planes. For instance, Wing Commander or X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter . Racing games are games which simulate driving different sort of cars. For instance, Need for Speed , NASCAR Racing , Gran Turismo or Driver .<br/><br/>Reff: http://nrich.maths.org/1374'),

Learning to play an instrument or a sport requires time and patience. It is all about steadily mastering new skills. The same is true when it comes to learning information â€” preparing for that quiz bowl, say, or studying for a big test.<br/><br/>As teachers, coaches and parents everywhere like to say: Practice makes perfect.<br/>Doing something over and over again doesnâ€™t just make it easier. It actually changes the brain. That may not come as a surprise. But exactly how that process happens has long been a mystery. Scientists have known that the brain continues to develop through our teenage years. But these experts used to think that those changes stopped once the brain matured.<br/>No more.<br/><br/>Recent data have been showing that the brain continues to change over the course of our lives. Cells grow. They form connections with new cells. Some stop talking to others. And itâ€™s not just nerve cells that shift and change as we learn. Other brain cells also get into the act.<br/><br/>Scientists have begun unlocking these secrets of how we learn, not only in huge blocks of tissue, but even within individual cells.<br/>Rewiring<br/><br/>The brain is not one big blob of tissue. Just six to seven weeks into the development of a human embryo, the brain starts to form into different parts. Later, these areas will each take on different roles. Consider the prefrontal cortex. Itâ€™s the region right behind your forehead. Thatâ€™s where you solve problems. Other parts of the cortex (the outer layer of the brain) help process sights and sounds. Deep in the brain, the hippocampus helps store memories. It also helps you figure out where things are located around you.<br/><br/>Scientists can see what part of the brain is active by using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. At the heart of every fMRI device is a strong magnet. It allows the device to detect changes in blood flow. Now, when a scientist asks a volunteer to perform a particular task â€” such as playing a game or learning something new â€” the machine reveals where blood flow within the brain is highest. That boost in blood flow highlights which cells are busy working.<br/>Many brain scientists use fMRI to map brain activity. Others use another type of brain scan, known as positron emission tomography, or PET. Experts have performed dozens of such studies. Each looked at how specific areas of the brain responded to specific tasks.<br/><br/>Nathan Spreng did something a little different: He decided to study the studies. Spreng is a neuroscientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. A neuroscientist studies the brain and nervous system. Spreng wanted to know how the brain changes â€” how it morphs a little bit â€” as we learn.<br/>He teamed up with two other researchers. Together, they analyzed 38 of those earlier studies. Each study had used an fMRI or PET scan to probe which regions of the brain turn on when people learn new tasks.<br/><br/>Areas that allow people to pay attention became most active as someone began a new task. But those attention areas became less active over time. Meanwhile, areas of the brain linked with daydreaming and mind-wandering became more active as people became more familiar with a task.<br/><br/>â€œAt the beginning, you require a lot of focused attention,â€ Spreng says. Learning to swing a bat requires a great deal of focus when you first try to hit a ball. But the more you practice, Spreng says, the less you have to think about what youâ€™re doing.<br/><br/>Extensive practice can even allow a person to perform a task while thinking about other things â€” or about nothing at all. A professional pianist, for example, can play a complex piece of music without thinking about which notes to play next. In fact, stopping to think about the task can actually interfere with a flawless performance. This is what musicians, athletes and others often refer to as being â€œin the zone.â€<br/>Cells that fire together, wire together<br/><br/>Sprengâ€™s findings involve the whole brain. However, those changes actually reflect whatâ€™s happening at the level of individual cells.<br/><br/>The brain is made up of billions of nerve cells, called neurons. These cells are chatty. They â€œtalkâ€ to each other, mostly using chemical messengers. Incoming signals cause a listening neuron to fire or send signals of its own. A cell fires when an electrical signal travels through it. The signal moves away from what is called the cell body, down through a long structure called an axon. When the signal reaches the end of the axon, it triggers the release of those chemical messengers. The chemicals then leap across a tiny gap. This triggers the next cell to fire. And on it goes.<br/>As we learn something new, cells that send and receive information about the task become more and more efficient. It takes less effort for them to signal the next cell about whatâ€™s going on. In a sense, the neurons become wired together.<br/><br/>Spreng detected that wiring. As cells in a brain area related to some task became more efficient, they used less energy to chat. This allowed more neurons in the â€œdaydreamingâ€ region of the brain to rev up their activity.'),

And thatâ€™s important. But it wonâ€™t make you smarter, says Kevin Beaver.<br/><br/>As a criminologist,he studies the causes of crime and ways to prevent it. Beaver works at Florida State University in Tallahassee. His research team wanted to know if different parenting styles influenced a childâ€™s intelligence. After all, Beaver notes, â€œintelligence has been linked to crime.â€<br/><br/>Previous research has suggested different types of parenting could affect a childâ€™s IQ. Short for intelligence quotient, IQ is a score that measures human intelligence.<br/><br/>But those earlier data hadnâ€™t separated out the effect of genetics on IQ. Beaverâ€™s team wanted to know: Are childrenâ€™s IQ scores really affected by how their parents raised them? Or are those scores just a reflection of what genes a child inherited?<br/><br/>To find out, the team pored over information from a study of more than 15,000 U.S. middle- and high-school students. Itâ€™s called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.<br/><br/>Starting in the 1994-to-1995 school year, researchers had asked students a series of questions. For instance: How warm and loving are your parents? How much do you talk with them? How close do you feel to your parents? How much do you think they care about you?<br/><br/>Students also were given a list of 10 activities. Then the questionnaire asked how many of those activities students had done with their parents in the previous week. Did they play sports together? Go shopping? Talk with each other over dinner? Watch a movie together?<br/><br/>Students also answered questions about how permissive their parents were. For example, did their parents let them choose their own friends, choose what to watch on TV or choose for themselves when to go to bed?<br/><br/>The researchers then gave the students a test to gauge their IQ. Called a Picture Vocabulary Test, it asked the students to link words and images. Scores on this test have been linked repeatedly to IQ. Later in life, between the ages of 18 and 26, these people were tested again.<br/><br/>Beaverâ€™s group was especially interested in results from a group of about 220 students who had been adopted. The parents who raised them had not passed on any genes to them. So if there was a link between the studentsâ€™ IQs and the way their parents raised them, the researchers should see it most clearly in the adopted studentsâ€™ scores.<br/><br/>But no such link emerged. Whether students reported their parents cared about them and did things with them â€” or reported that they did not â€” it had no impact on the their IQ. This means a personâ€™s IQ is largely the result of the genes we inherit from our biological parents.<br/><br/>What does Beaver make of the new findings?<br/><br/>We all have strengths and weaknesses, he says. That means some of us will have to work harder than others to do well. And in some cases, other people will always be better than us at certain things.<br/><br/>â€œThe key is to find what you are good at and what you enjoy.â€ Then, he says, â€œWork your hardest to become the best you can be.â€<br/><br/>J.C. Barnes is a criminologist who studies how genetics and the environment affect crime. He works at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio.

When two players collide, the magnets in each playerâ€™s helmet should repel the otherâ€™s. This should reduce the force of the collision.<br/><br/>Football helmets now work by dispersing the energy as an impact occurs, explains neuroscientist Raymond Colello. Helmets with built-in magnets could put a brake on an impact before it happens, he says. Colello works at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. He shared his teamâ€™s data November 15 at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.<br/><br/>The magnet idea hasnâ€™t been tested yet in helmets with real players, notes Judy Cameron. â€œBut a lot of thought has gone into it,â€ she says. Indeed, she adds, the data shown on the ability of the magnets to repel each other â€œlooked extremely promising.â€ Cameron is a neuroscientist at Pennsylvaniaâ€™s University of Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>On the field, football players often suffer a concussion. Thatâ€™s a brain injury that can cause headaches â€” or even leave a person unconscious. The blow may cause the head to move quickly or come to a rapid stop.<br/><br/>Each year in the United States, there are 100,000 concussions among the nearly 1.2 million people of all ages that play football. Colello wants to reduce this risk.<br/><br/>To do so, he is testing magnets made from neodymium (NEE-oh-DIM-ee-um), a rare-earth element. Rare earths are a group of metals that tend to be soft, bendable and chemically reactive. Magnets made from them are the most powerful ones you can buy.<br/><br/>Colelloâ€™s new helmet would hold three such magnets. They would add about 0.45 kilogram (1 pound) to the helmet. A normal football helmet weighs about 1.6 to 2.5 kilograms (3.5 to 5.5 pounds). When placed 0.6 centimeter (0.25 inch) away from each other, two of the magnets (with their like poles facing one another) exert nearly 45 kilograms (100 pounds) of repulsive force.<br/><br/>Colello tested his magnets with the same procedure used to evaluate football helmets. First, he placed magnets on the front of a weight. Then he let the weight drop from various heights onto another magnet. The falling magnets created the same range of impact forces that football players can encounter.<br/><br/>â€œAt 48 inches [122 centimeters], if you dropped a standard helmet and it hit a stationary object, it would create 120 gâ€™s of force,â€ Colello said. That acceleration is equal to 120 times the force of gravity. â€œWith the magnets, we drop that to below 100 gâ€™s,â€ Colello says of the collision force. That reduction can be important: Concussions readily occur at impacts greater than 100 gâ€™s.<br/><br/>Colello has ordered customized arc-shaped magnets that can be fitted inside helmets for testing. He plans to send helmeted crash-test dummy heads toward each other down a zip line. When they collide, special sensors called accelerometers will measure the force of the impacts.<br/><br/>Helmets fitted with magnets could reduce the risk of concussions by up to 80 percent, Colelloâ€™s data indicate. Adding the magnet technology could also up the cost of a helmet by $50 to $100.<br/><br/>The magnets do attract metallic objects. However, football leagues often prohibit players from wearing jewelry during games.<br/><br/>Another safety concern is whether the magnets are dangerous to have near human heads. Colello says that a 30- to 60-minute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure produces magnetic fields 10 to 30 times as strong as those in magnet-bearing helmets.<br/>Power Words<br/><br/>acceleration <s>The rate at which the speed or direction of something changes over time.<br/><br/>accelerometer <s>An instrument for measuring vibrations or a change in the rate of movement.

What is his role until the product is ready, is a question asked by many. Well, I was part of the same pool until we started working on our own startup. Letâ€™s just say that the work is abysmal while the product is getting ready but your actions in this period will have a huge effect on your startupâ€™s eventual success. You need to get prospects to pilot, funds to run, a good team to work with, mentors to guide, and so on. Personal experiences are the best teachers, and hereâ€™s a quick list of the important aspects that worked for us while the product was getting ready:<br/>1) Â  Â Spy: <s>â€˜Imitation is the best form of flatteryâ€™ doesnâ€™t hold much meaning from a product creation perspective. However, one can always learn from the competitors. Spy on them, like a cop! Follow them on social media, read their blogs, watch their demos, product videos, pitch decks, clients list, growth, etc....Register as a customer and ask them to provide a demo of their product, ask hell of a lot of questions (which might come handy while answering your own customers), ask them to send help docs, observe how they follow-up to get you onboard.<br/>2) Â  Â Hustle: <s>Startups should hustle to the core, be it getting clients or investors or accelerators or startup competitions. Talk to as many prospects as possible, create a simple PPT, talk to them as if your product is ready and get their feedback or commitments. Same works with accelerators and investors as well. There are numerous examples of startups that have raised funding or got into accelerators with just a PPT. Who knows, people might like your idea on PPT itself! <s>My personal advice to every start-up is to explore and apply to various startup competitions across their niche. Itâ€™s all about hustling; there isnâ€™t a defined process as such.<br/>3) Â  Â Read: <s>If youâ€™re a startup guy, you should be reading a lot every day. Itâ€™s good to learn what fellow entrepreneurs are doing, dos and donâ€™ts, tips and tricks, who raised funding, who got acquired and whatâ€™s happening in entire startup eco-system. Staying ahead of the game is a trick that has never failed. Along with great learnings and insights, it keeps you connected with like-minded people within the startup ecosystem, the place where you belong to.<br/>4) Â  Â Communities: Being active in communities like Hackernews, Quora, ProductHunt, Betalist, Growthhackers.com and other relevant forums adds a lot of value to your profile. Very few people get the requisite response to these highly curated and engaging platforms, and the start-ups gain a lot due to the immense value these platforms add to it. You can submit your own startup once your product is launched or let such platforms reach out to you. I know a few startups who have dedicated community managers to make sure they are active on all these platforms. If the need be, hire one!<br/>5) Â  Â Network: Make a habit to attend almost all the startup events in your vicinity. This is the place where you meet, pitch and network with lot of fellow entrepreneurs and investors. You donâ€™t really need to have a product to pitch, just make an elevator pitch to as many people as possible. This creates a lot of buzz by the time you actually release your product. Even at the time of raising money, people recognize you and they recall that youâ€™re in this startup space for quite a long time. It also important to remember that attending events doesnâ€™t drive you followers or investors, you should make sure to stay in touch with them. Follow them on social media, send them updates and extend your network.<br/>6) Â  Â Share: Sharing is caring! Do share your experiences and observations with fellow entrepreneurs. There are plenty of ways to do it and of the best ways is to have a blog and share your experiences. Another interesting way is through a â€˜guest postâ€™, if you feel it makes more sense to post it somewhere else. Again this builds credibility and would help you reach followers, prospects and future investors in no time.<br/>7) Â  Â Sleep Well: Last but not least, donâ€™t forget to sleep well, and occasionally order a Six-Pack Of Craft Beer for yourself and the team. This is the best time to savor, since the path ahead would constitute many sleepless nights!<br/>FROM yourstory.<br/>Thanks,'),

You went over budget, blew past deadlines and became frustrated with just about everyone involved at some point.<br/>The bad news? It was rough.<br/>The really bad news? It was probably your teamâ€™s fault.<br/>Most CEOs have serious misconceptions about web development. This is a problem because businesses are more reliant than ever on their online presence.<br/>CEOs in companies of all sizes struggle with this. Here are six myths that most CEOs struggle with:<br/>1. Website development is easy:<br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> Clients commonly request a <a>quot;simple<a>quot; 20-page website with a log-in setup, online payment, a blog and other widgets.<br/>Websites such as Facebook and Craigslist may appear simple, but the necessary development work is time-consuming and complicated. The strange thing is that the simpler the design, often the more expensive the siteis. Some requests that seem small could involve complicated development work and require days of programming.<br/><br/>2. Everyone should be involved:<br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> Rather than packing all the staff into a conference room to rattle off ideas involve only the people whoâ€™ll be doing the work.<br/>Compile your content strategy, brand assets, business objectives and user flows. Donâ€™t spend time mulling deep technical planning, database architecture, layouts, designs or widgets.<br/><br/>3. Websites are a commodity:<br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> With the advent of templates, sites like 99designs and offshore development, many businesspeople harbor the misperception that web design is a cheap commodity.<br/>Taking advantage of already created templates might work for some companies, but for those serious about their brand and online presence, such alternatives wonâ€™t suffice long-term.<br/>Consider your website an investment and dedicate appropriate resources toward it. Find a team of designers who understands your business, ask the right questions and have happy customers. A good team will help you manage your goals along with your budget and find optimal solutions. It may seem expensive, but the return on investment will be worth it.<br/><br/>4. Once a site is built, itâ€™s done:<br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s>Web development isnâ€™t a once-and-done activity. Once your site is launched, it will need to be maintained. Many midmarket companies have round-the-clock teams monitoring their sites to ensure they remain without glitches.<br/>Even if your website doesnâ€™t handle a high volume of traffic, you still need someone keeping an eye on functionality. Youâ€™ll also need security updates and fresh content for SEO purposes.<br/><br/>5. Anyone can create a great user experience:<br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> You canâ€™t build the website yourself. Focus on leading your business and improving your products. Your intern, cousin or IT guy canâ€™t build it either. A lot more that goes into a site than basic knowledge of web design, especially when building payment systems and ensuring integration with the company<r>s internal systems.<br/>There are free website-building tools that can be great for bootstrapped startup or running a small business site. But they arenâ€™t robust enough for the needs of most established businesses.<br/>For your website, you may need a team to design mostly from scratch, which requires a specific skill set. Let the web design firm hired do what it does best, but make sure its staffers are asking the right questions about the target audiences before they start.<br/><br/>6. Itâ€™s your website, so you dictate the design:<br/> <s> <s> <s> It<r>s natural to want to micromanage your company<r>s website. Unfortunately, unless youâ€™re a web designer, this isnâ€™t the job for you. You need to trust your web designer if you want site visitors to become paying customers.<br/>Web designers will understand your vision, but you need to let them design. Theyâ€™re knowledgeable about structure and what helps visitors convert into customers. <br/>From Entrepreneur,<br/>Thanks.'),

Here are five tips from that experience that you can put to work on your own:<br/><br/>1. Prioritize for the best impact<br/><br/>Not every user is going to use every feature of your software, but some features almost every user will use. Not every user who uses a given feature is going to use it frequently, but some users will use that feature all of the time. Take a look at the grid below:<br/><br/>When deciding which features to improve on, which to add, and which to avoid, it really helps to have a picture of how many and how frequently users are using a given feature. Take a look at the major features in your app and features you may be considering further down in your roadmap and align them to their respective appropriate area of the grid above.<br/><br/>You donâ€™t want to waste of all of your cycles working on a feature that will only benefit a few users only some of the time while putting off a feature thatâ€™ll benefit all of your users or will benefit users frequently! Try to prioritize your feature development in such a way that you have at least one high-impact improvement per release to maximize the number of your users that feel that their feedback is being addressed and their needs met on an ongoing basis. The highest-impact features are going to be those in that upper left corner â€“ the ones that impact most users most of the time!<br/><br/>2. Remove / prevent the extraneous<br/><br/>Taking a look at the scope and features of your app using the grid above may call attention to certain parts of your app that are used infrequently by few users. Consider dropping or scaling back these features. The less your users have to navigate through in your app, the more quickly and easily they can access the parts of your app they want to use. Also, the slimmer your code base, the easier it should be to maintain and support, and the easier it should be to focus on the parts that matter most to your users!<br/><br/>Whenever a new feature request or change for your apps comes your way, carefully consider where it might fit into the grid above. Donâ€™t be afraid to say no to feature requests if they fit into the lower right corner of the grid. Donâ€™t be afraid to say no to feature requests if you think they will bloat or make your software too complex for your target set of users to work with. What is your app meant to do? How will it make your usersâ€™ lives better? If a feature doesnâ€™t fit in with the vision you have for your app and it wonâ€™t make your usersâ€™ lives better, donâ€™t add it.<br/><br/>Removing features is a lot more difficult than preventing them from getting added in the first place, so be very selective about how you choose to expand your app!<br/><br/>3. Speed things up<br/><br/>You donâ€™t need to be a UX expert to know that the faster your apps function, the better experience your users are going to have interacting with them. One very effective way to improve your applicationâ€™s user experience is to test common pathways through the app and see where you can speed them up.<br/><br/>What are the five most important features of your app? (Which ones reside in the upper left of the grid?) Run through tasks involving these features multiple times and time how long it takes for each run. Are the times reasonable? Is the majority of the time spent waiting on the application to process requests or is the majority of the time spent out filling form fields and clicking around?<br/><br/>If youâ€™re spending a lot of time waiting on the app to process something, try to track down what might be causing the lag and find ways to optimize things. Perhaps one of the libraries you depend on could be swapped out with a faster one? Maybe some of your code isnâ€™t as efficient as it could be?<br/><br/>If youâ€™re spending a lot of time clicking and filling out information in the interface, see if you can streamline the user interface to require less information from the user. For example, do you really need both the userâ€™s home phone and mobile numbers? Drop one! Do you really need the user to upload a profile picture? Check libravatar or gravatar and see if there is already one available for their email address!<br/><br/>In cases where you have long-running processes and itâ€™s simply not possible to speed them up any more â€“ for example, youâ€™re calling out to an external app and waiting for data to return from that â€“ evaluate how well you are setting your userâ€™s expectations on wait time. Are you displaying a progress bar to them while the longer-running tasks are happening? Can you provide them with a time estimate (even ballpark is helpful)?<br/><br/>If your application has a sign up / initial run workflow, you want to spend special attention to optimizing it so that users can get through it quickly. Users will quickly abandon your app and try a new one without even giving it a fair shot if it takes them too long to get through the initial sign up process.<br/><br/>4. Make more choices for your users<br/><br/>Speaking of speeding things up for your users â€“ one way you can do this is to limit the amount of choices users have to make while using your application. Itâ€™s you, my application developer friend, that users are relying on as an expert in the ways of whatever it is that your application does. Users trust you to make set sane defaults based on your domain expertise; when you set defaults, you are also alleviating users from having to make a choice that â€“ depending on their level of expertise â€“ may be quite hard for them to understand.<br/><br/>This isnâ€™t to say you should eliminate all choices and configuration options from your application! Let users ease into it, though. Give them a good default so that your application requires less of them to start, and as they gain expertise and confidence in using your app over time, they can explore the preferences and change those settings based on their needs when they are ready.<br/><br/>Too many options is definitely a bad thing, though â€“ if they are too many combinatorial ways for any given user to interact with your application, it makes supporting your app and providing a consistent user experience difficult. When you decide to provide an option, think about it in terms of the grid â€“ is this an option useful to many users frequently? Is it a critical need or a very niche issue that could be resolved in some other way?<br/><br/>5. Design before you code<br/><br/>This is a big tip, but very important. Even if you donâ€™t have access to a UX designer, youâ€™ve got access to pencil and paper. Do some quick sketches of how you think a feature might work â€“ use one sheet of paper per screen involved. Show these sketches to others on your team, or even better, buy some friends who might be potential users each a cup of coffee and ask them to sit down with you and go through the screens. What problem are you trying to solve with the feature youâ€™re working on? Explain the problem to your testers. Then ask them â€“ without too much hand holding â€“ to point at where on each screen they would think to go in order to try to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Early testing like this is great to catch flaws in your assumptions about how the user interface should be laid out, and it ensures your development time isnâ€™t wasted on a solution that doesnâ€™t solve the key problem your application should be solving!'),

In computer networks, networked computing devices pass data to each other along data connections. Data is transferred in the form of packets. The connections (network links) between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet.<br/><br/>Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes. Nodes can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, servers as well as networking hardware. Two such devices are said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other.<br/><br/>Computer networks differ in the physical media used to transmit their signals, the communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network<r>s size, topology and organizational intent. In most cases, communications protocols are layered on (i.e. work using) other more specific or more general communications protocols, except for the physical layer that directly deals with the physical media.<br/><br/>Computer networks support applications such as access to the World Wide Web, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications.'),

A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.

But not everyone knows what the grid is, let alone the Smart Grid. <a>quot;The grid,<a>quot; refers to the electric grid, a network of transmission lines, substations, transformers and more that deliver electricity from the power plant to your home or business. Itâ€™s what you plug into when you flip on your light switch or power up your computer. Our current electric grid was built in the 1890s and improved upon as technology advanced through each decade. Today, it consists of more than 9,200 electric generating units with more than 1 million megawatts of generating capacity connected to more than 300,000 miles of transmission lines. Although the electric grid is considered an engineering marvel, we are stretching its patchwork nature to its capacity. To move forward, we need a new kind of electric grid, one that is built from the bottom up to handle the groundswell of digital and computerized equipment and technology dependent on itâ€”and one that can automate and manage the increasing complexity and needs of electricity in the 21st Century.<br/>What Makes a Grid â€œSmart?â€<br/><br/>In short, the digital technology that allows for two-way communication between the utility and its customers, and the sensing along the transmission lines is what makes the grid smart. Like the Internet, the Smart Grid will consist of controls, computers, automation, and new technologies and equipment working together, but in this case, these technologies will work with the electrical grid to respond digitally to our quickly changing electric demand.<br/><br/><br/>What does a Smart Grid do?<br/><br/>The Smart Grid represents an unprecedented opportunity to move the energy industry into a new era of reliability, availability, and efficiency that will contribute to our economic and environmental health. During the transition period, it will be critical to carry out testing, technology improvements, consumer education, development of standards and regulations, and information sharing between projects to ensure that the benefits we envision from the Smart Grid become a reality. The benefits associated with the Smart Grid include:<br/><br/> <s> <s>More efficient transmission of electricity<br/> <s> <s>Quicker restoration of electricity after power disturbances<br/> <s> <s>Reduced operations and management costs for utilities, and ultimately lower power costs for consumers<br/> <s> <s>Reduced peak demand, which will also help lower electricity rates<br/> <s> <s>Increased integration of large-scale renewable energy systems<br/> <s> <s>Better integration of customer-owner power generation systems, including renewable energy systems<br/> <s> <s>Improved security<br/><br/>Today, an electricity disruption such as a blackout can have a domino effectâ€”a series of failures that can affect banking, communications, traffic, and security. This is a particular threat in the winter, when homeowners can be left without heat. A smarter grid will add resiliency to our electric power system and make it better prepared to address emergencies such as severe storms, earthquakes, large solar flares, and terrorist attacks. Because of its two-way interactive capacity, the Smart Grid will allow for automatic rerouting when equipment fails or outages occur. This will minimize outages and minimize the effects when they do happen. When a power outage occurs, Smart Grid technologies will detect and isolate the outages, containing them before they become large-scale blackouts. The new technologies will also help ensure that electricity recovery resumes quickly and strategically after an emergencyâ€”routing electricity to emergency services first, for example. In addition, the Smart Grid will take greater advantage of customer-owned power generators to produce power when it is not available from utilities. By combining these <a>quot;distributed generation<a>quot; resources, a community could keep its health center, police department, traffic lights, phone system, and grocery store operating during emergencies. In addition, the Smart Grid is a way to address an aging energy infrastructure that needs to be upgraded or replaced. Itâ€™s a way to address energy efficiency, to bring increased awareness to consumers about the connection between electricity use and the environment. And itâ€™s a way to bring increased national security to our energy systemâ€”drawing on greater amounts of home-grown electricity that is more resistant to natural disasters and attack.<br/><br/><br/>Giving Consumers Control<br/><br/>The Smart Grid is not just about utilities and technologies; it is about giving you the information and tools you need to make choices about your energy use. If you already manage activities such as personal banking from your home computer, imagine managing your electricity in a similar way. A smarter grid will enable an unprecedented level of consumer participation. For example, you will no longer have to wait for your monthly statement to know how much electricity you use. With a smarter grid, you can have a clear and timely picture of it. <a>quot;Smart meters,<a>quot; and other mechanisms, will allow you to see how much electricity you use, when you use it, and its cost. Combined with real-time pricing, this will allow you to save money by using less power when electricity is most expensive. While the potential benefits of the Smart Grid are usually discussed in terms of economics, national security, and renewable energy goals, the Smart Grid has the potential to help you save money by helping you to manage your electricity use and choose the best times to purchase electricity. And you can save even more by generating your own power.<br/><br/><br/>Building and Testing the Smart Grid<br/><br/>The Smart Grid will consist of millions of pieces and partsâ€”controls, computers, power lines, and new technologies and equipment. It will take some time for all the technologies to be perfected, equipment installed, and systems tested before it comes fully on line. And it wonâ€™t happen all at onceâ€”the Smart Grid is evolving, piece by piece, over the next decade or so. Once mature, the Smart Grid will likely bring the same kind of transformation that the Internet has already brought to the way we live, work, play, and learn.<br/>'),

However, In order to do so they struggle with the growing number and complexity of hardware devices in their networks. However this is very difficult due to the time taken for equipment certification and recruiting operators for them, let alone the cost pressure due to space and power requirement. Thus Service Providers now aim to change how networks are deployed and managed. Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) seems to solve these problems.<br/><br/>Network Functions Virtualisation aims to evolve standard IT virtualisation technology to consolidate many network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage, which could be located in Datacentres, Network Nodes and in the end user premises. It involves the implementation of network functions in software that can run on a range of industry standard server hardware, and that can be moved to, or instantiated in, various locations in the network as required, without the need for installation of new equipment.'),

Will you make it?<br/><br/>Success will depend on lots of things. Your distance from the goal post, the strength of your kick, your focus, and even the angle of your foot â€” all will affect the outcome. Even the wind will make a difference.<br/><br/>Each of these factors is known as a variable. That means each can vary, or change. Some variables also can affect each other.<br/><br/>If your kick depended on only one variable, you might be able to easily gauge your likelihood of propelling that ball through the goalposts. But as soon as multiple variables come into play, the human brain finds it harder and harder to calculate the outcome. Luckily, a new computer program can do the work, almost instantaneously.<br/>It considers each variable involved in a kick. It then virtually adds the impacts of each to predict â€” or model â€” how things would turn out in the real world. Based on all of the calculations, it shows if you would have scored a field goal.<br/>Such a computer model also could let you adjust the different variables and test how that might change the result. What if a wind gust kicks up? What if itâ€™s raining and the extra moisture in the air adds a little extra drag â€” or friction â€” on the ball? The computer could rerun its calculations, changing each factor one by one or in various combinations.<br/>Computer models are in use all around us. Some, like the new football model, focus on sports. Others examine questions about climate and farming. Still others deal with networks, those connections linking people and things. These models suggest who you might want to friend on social-media websites. They recommend news, movies or music online. They even help grocery stores keep popular snacks in stock.<br/>Now, new research is leading to even more efficient computer models for studying certain types of networks. The results could help in developing new medicines, in saving ecosystems and even in solving crimes.<br/><br/>Start with the real world:<br/><br/>People create models to represent some real thing. When children model people, buildings, cars or other things, they tend to use plastic, clay or other raw materials. Computers donâ€™t. They model things out of numbers and mathematical relationships. Because their models are not physical â€” something, for instance, that you can touch â€” scientists refer to computer models as being virtual representations. They are constructed from data, math and computer programming. Although they exist only in a computer, they can help us understand how the real world works.<br/>Think about a child<r>s model car. It can resemble a real car, right down to its bodywork and details. Now think about a computer model of a car. It wouldnâ€™t look like a real car. But it could behave like one. The data and instructions fed into this model could reflect the most important properties of a real car. It might let engineers see how a real car would steer and brake, for instance.<br/><a>quot;All computer models are based on some kind of abstraction, <a>quot; explains Yusheng Feng. He is a biomechanical engineer at the University of Texas at San Antonio.<br/>Computer modelers start with important features of something in the real world. In October 2013, Feng and his students introduced a new computer model for kicking an American-style football. The team started by watching real football players in action. They identified the different laws of physics involved when players kick. Then they expressed those laws using math.<br/>For example, one of the laws of physics first expressed by Isaac Newton explains how force relates to a ball in motion. It says force equals mass times acceleration (F = m x a). Mathematical expressions, like this, which use numbers to relate two things that are equal, are known as equations. Other equations that Fengâ€™s team used reflect the effects of the ballâ€™s rotation, any wind and additional factors.<br/><br/>Testing, testing... <br/><br/>Writing a computer model isnâ€™t the end of the job. Researchers need to know if the model works.<br/><br/>Suppose you design a weather model. To test it, you might feed in real data from the previous year. If the model predicted snow for days that actually were hot and sunny, somethingâ€™s definitely wrong. Youâ€™d have to go back and tinker with the model.<br/><br/>A model also should be reliable. <a>quot;You don<r>t want it to just work one time,<a>quot; stresses Klymko. Researchers might have models run calculations thousands or even millions of times to make sure they work.<br/><br/>Computer modeling is also <a>quot;an evolving concept,<a>quot; says Lizaso. Computer models for farming first came out in the late 1970s. Since then, scientists have learned more about crop science, climate change and other factors. <a>quot;The idea is to improve existing models and add additional properties so they can perform better,<a>quot; he says.<br/>'),

Considering this, hereâ€™s are some of the key challenges facing our industry today as well as some suggested strategies for how to deal with them:<br/><br/>1.Making data a priority â€“ Customers value access to data more than they do voice. Even though service providers may not own OTT services, they are still expected to provide superior user experience and performance when their subscribers use them. The ongoing rise in OTT players is creating a challenge for telco operators that are not earning any extra income off of the additional bandwidth that users are demanding. In order to deal with this, telecommunications providers need to shift from legacy voice-centric strategies to data-driven plans. Along with this, operators should look at expanding their data-carrying capacity to provide superior service to both existing and new subscribers.<br/><br/>2. Monetizing new services â€“ With the consumersâ€™ ever-increasing demand for data, telco providers cannot afford to ignore OTT services. In order to compete with existing OTT players, telco providers can start providing high-quality, value-added services such as HD video conferencing or mobile office environments. Telecommunications providers must deliver these services quicklyâ€”a new technology roll-out needs to take months, not years. Reducing time to market will allow players to remain at the forefront of innovation in the minds of consumers. The next big thing will be here next year, not next decade.<br/><br/>3. Building a brand â€“ A key to success in developing these new services is building a brand thatâ€™s known for innovation. To remain relevant, telco operators cannot simply offer the same things as every other player. They must differentiate themselves by investing in the business intelligence necessary to understand consumer wishes before their competitors and then using that knowledge to build applications and delivery models that customers want to purchase. Part of this will be adding features that other players cannot match, such as enhanced performance and uptime and exclusive content.<br/><br/>4. Leveraging the right infrastructure â€“ With data usage on the rise, telecommunications operators need to examine their existing framework and make adaptations to increase flexibility and reliability when necessary. Choosing controlled and scalable carrier-grade servers can help with this, as can capitalizing on new concepts, such as cloud-based solutions machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity.<br/><br/>5. Controlling costs â€“ With all the new service rollouts happening and changes taking place, operators must be sure to control the costs of the current solutions so they can invest in whatâ€™s coming next. Developing scalable services now can help manage future costs, since operators will be able to react rapidly to market changes.<br/><br/><br/>Lets See How do we solve these problems<br/><br/>Reffer : http://www.telco-ott.com/opinions/2013/06/five-major-challenges-for-telecommunications-providers/'),

But the crucial idea that emerged in the 1930s is that there can be a single universal computer that can just be programmed to do any possible computation. In other words, one can have a single piece of hardware, but just change the software (or the input) to get different computations done.<br/><br/>Turing machines were invented by Alan Turing in 1936, and were the first clear example of a system that could be a universal computer. <br/>So, turing machine is a mathematical model of a hypothetical computing machine which can use a predefined set of rules to determine a result from a set of input variables. It was invented not to compute tables of numbers but to solve problems in logic and to probe the limits of computation and human thought.<br/>A Turing machine is a finite state machine that has an unlimited supply of paper tape that it can write on and read back. There are many formulations of a Turing machine, but essentially the machine reads a symbol from the tape, which is used as an input to the finite state machine. This takes the input symbol and according to it and the current state does three things:<br/><br/> <s> 1. Read the symbol on the square under the head.<br/> <s> 2. Edit the symbol by writing a new symbol or erasing it.<br/> <s> 3. Move the tape left of right by one square so that the machine can read and edit the symbol on a neighboring square.<br/><br/>A Turing machine can also perform a special action â€“ it can stop or halt â€“ and surprisingly it is this behavior that attracts a great deal of attention.<br/>For example, a Turing machine is said to recognize a sequence of symbols written on the tape if it is started on the tape and halts in a special state called a final state. What is interesting about this idea is that there are sequences that a Turing machine can recognize that a finite state machine can<r>t.<br/>For example, a finite state machine can recognize a sequence that has three As followed by three Bs e.g. AAABBB and so can a Turing machine. But only a Turing machine can recognize a sequence that has an arbitrary number of As followed by the same number of Bs.That is a Turing machine is more powerful than a finite state machine because it can count.<br/>This at first seems very odd but a little thought reveals it to be quite reasonable, obvious even!<br/>To discover if the number of Bs is the same as the number of As you have to do something that is equivalent to counting them, or at least matching them up, and given there can be arbitrarily many input A symbols even before you ever see a B you need unlimited storage to count or match them up. The finite state machine doesn<r>t have unlimited storage but the Turing machine does in the form of its tape!<br/>'),

A pessimistic mindset, by contrast, causes the brain to feel threatened, closing it off to new opportunities.<br/> <a>quot;Your brain is three times more creative in a positive state,<a>quot; says Achor. While a positive mindset is crucial all year round, it<r>s particularly important towards the end of the year, when we begin to reflect on the past and set our goals for the year ahead.<br/> Follow these four tips to get into a positive state of mind:<br/> <br/> 1. Don<r>t start at zero. When making resolutions, start by listing your accomplishments in the previous year. <a>quot;The brain accelerates towards goals the closer it perceives success,<a>quot; says Achor. For the same reason that marathon runners tend to pick up speed at 26.1 miles, our brains release chemicals called success accelerants, that give us more energy as we perceive being closer to the finish line. Starting your resolution list with a blank sheet of paper means you lose the advantage of these success accelerants.<br/> This strategy can be used on a daily basis throughout the rest of the year. Instead of making a list of all the things you have left to accomplish in the day, start by writing down all the things you<r>ve already accomplished and checking those off. When your brain sees the checkmarks, it releases these success accelerants, putting you in a positive mindset and allowing you to speed towards achieving the rest of the goals on the list.<br/> <br/> 2. Start your day with a positive email. Do you start off your day by scanning your inbox for the most urgent emails? How often are those urgent messages positive? To start your day in a positive mindset, Achor suggests writing a positive email to a friend, co-worker, client or even a stranger. Achor once sent an email to a former high-school teacher telling him how his class affected his life. By sending these positive emails, your brain is starting the day not with a threat (a negative email), but with a social connection, something Achor says is the greatest predictor of happiness.<br/> <br/> 3. Use positive language in goal-setting. While many of us make resolutions to stop a negative behavior such as smoking or eating junk food, Achor says we should instead focus on positive habits to replace the negative one you want to break. Rather than making a resolution to avoid the office vending machine, resolve to bring healthy snacks to work every day. By changing the language of your resolution from a negative to a positive, your brain doesnâ€™t waste its resources dwelling on the negative habit youâ€™re trying to avoid but instead uses its energy towards the new positive habit.<br/> <br/> 4. Focus on positive habits. Incorporate positive habits into your daily routine and experience the benefits of an optimistic outlook. Some positive habits that Achor says have proven effective include writing down three things youâ€™re grateful for every day, meditating by paying attention to the movement of your breath, or journaling about a positive experience. When Achor asked a group of KPMG employees to choose one of these positive habits to do for two minutes over 21 consecutive days, he found significantly higher levels of job satisfaction, job effectiveness and lower stress levels.<br/> Reference: Entrepreneur.<br/> Thanks.'),

Stubblefield in 1908, the Kentuckianâ€™s vision was really for a cave radio. The first true mobile phone devices were the size of a large briefcase and weighed up to 80 lbs, making them suitable only for in vehicle use, and the first wireless networks were set up to handle just a few callers at any given time, servicing only large cities and highways by the mid forties. <br/> <s>Mobile communications as we know them didnâ€™t come into being until the geniuses at Bell Labs figured out how to create overlapping â€œcellsâ€ which could allow a mobile phone user to remain connected while moving from point to point. (Previously, moving out of range of a wireless tower meant dropping the call.) <br/> <s>Martin Cooper of Motorola is credited with creating the first true â€œcell phoneâ€ in 1983: the Motorola DynaTac 8000X. This is the big phone carried by Michael Douglas in the epic film â€œWall Streetâ€. It was still generally installed in vehicles as it was too big to fit in a pocket, but could be carried outside the vehicle. <br/> <s>Six years later the Motorola MicroTac 9800X came on the market; this phone was small enough (barely) to fit in a jacket pocket. There was still an antenna to pull up, but the bottom half of the phone flipped down and open to reveal the smaller keypad. Julia Roberts carried one in â€œConspiracy Theoryâ€, Kelsey Grammer owned one as â€œFrasierâ€, and Robin Williamsâ€™ MicroTac was buried by the neighborâ€™s dog in the first segment of the movie â€œHookâ€. <br/> <s>Motorola continued to dominate the mobile landscape, coming out with the Motorola International 3200 in 1992. This was the first â€œdigitalâ€ mobile phone, depending on GSM technology instead of the standard analog network. These phones still work today on GSM networks. <br/> <s>Following three years later came the Motorola StarTac - the first true â€œflipâ€ phone (to the delight of Star Trek fans everywhere who had been awaiting the arrival of a real â€œcommunicatorâ€ for years.) The clam-shell StarTac also featured one of the first display screens standard on a cell phone. <br/> <s>Nokia came on the scene in 1992 with the 1011. This was the first mass produced GSM cell phone that could receive SMS (texts). The phone had a memory capable of storing 99 numbers! The 1011 was only produced for 2 years before it was replaced in 1994 by the 2110 - a sleeker model that featured the now famous Nokia ring-tone. <br/> <s>The Nokia 8110 came out in 1996. Instead of a flipping open, the bottom half of the 8110 slid down, creating a elongated curved shape that quickly earned the device the moniker â€œbanana phoneâ€. This phone was used in the first Matrix movie, and became a consumer favorite. <br/> <s>In 1996, Nokia also introduced the Nokia Communicator 9000. This was the worldâ€™s first â€œsmart-phoneâ€. Originally it had a clumsy GEOS operating system, but this was quickly upgraded over the next few years to Symbian. The phone slide open to reveal a full keyboard. Val Kilmer carried one in his role as Simon Templar in â€œSaintâ€. More sophisticated versions appeared in 1998, 2000, and 2002. <br/> <s>Over the past decade, mobile phones have steadily become smaller and smarter, with predictive text function, auto-correct, GPS, and more. Siemens and Samsung soon joined the mobile phone industry, and in 2007 the first iPhone hit the market - selling one million devices in just 74 days. Antennas went internal, and profiles became slimmer and cleaner.'),

Hawk Eye: This is currently one of the most popular technologies used in the world of sports. It allows tracking the trajectory of the ball, thus helping take correct decisions. The technology is widely used in cricket and tennis and is expected to be used in soccer in 2012, with the starting point being Barclays Premier League. <br/> <s>In tennis the Hawk Eye offers computerized illustrations of the arc of a bouncing ball and identifies the exact position of the ball when it hits the ground, helping the umpire and line judges identify the winner of the point. <br/> <s>It would be interesting to note that the system engages 4 high-speed cameras that take images at different angles around the tennis court and triangulates the location, speed and direction of the ball using the data collected from each cam. <br/> <s>This year FIFA allowed the system to be used to identify <a>quot;goal<a>quot; or <a>quot;no goal<a>quot; situations. The decision was made after the 2010 World Cup, when millions of England fans witnessed Frank Lampard mark a goal in the match against Germany but the referee did not validate it. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#2. Radar Guns: This technology is also used in tennis. Its goal is to inform viewers about the speed of a player<r>s serve. Although it does not help in taking decisions, it is an interesting source of information for everyone watching a game of tennis, including journalists and those registering World records. <br/> <s>The radars are usually located behind baselines and function on the principle of the Doppler effect, i.e. the faster the tennis ball is going away from the sensor, the more extensive the waves bouncing off the ball will be when they come back. <br/> <s>For a better understanding: when the car approaches you at a high speed you hear the level of noise rising and when it passed you the noise slowly fades away. The same phenomenon was used by astronomers when they came up with the conclusion that our universe is expanding. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3#. Net-Cord Sensor: The net-cord sensor is not a very complicated technology - it simply translates vibrations into electric power. <br/> <s>It represents a piezoelectric device that makes use of the same technology as a speaker or microphone. <br/> <s>Used in tennis, the gadget is attached to the net in order to signal when a ball has hit the net during a serve. It helps the referee take a decision of whether to call a serve or not. <br/> <s>Here<r>s how it works: when the ball hits the net it generates vibrations that are detected by the sensor and the latter produces a sound signal. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4#. Computer-Generated Line: This technology is used mainly in football, baseball and soccer. It represents a computer-generated virtual stripe that is projected onto the field and seen only by the TV audience. The line helps viewers get a better understanding on what happened on the field. <br/> <s>In football the virtual line is called the Yellow First Down line and it shows the exact position that the offense must reach for a first down. <br/> <s>The technology is rather complex - in order to project the line it is required to have several cameras, computers and technicians. <br/> <s>In soccer the virtual line allows viewers to see whether a player was in offside position or not. Unfortunately the line cannot influence the decision of the referee and is just there for the TV viewer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5#. Instant replay: This technology allows replaying of video footage of a certain event or incident in extremely short time, thus helping judges make important decisions. It is used in live television broadcasting of sports events to show a part of game which was important or notable, or a play that was somewhat unclear on first sight. <br/> <s>A number of sports organizations gave permission to referees to consult replay footage prior to making a decision regarding a dubious play. Such consulting has several name: video referee, video umpire, instant replay official and others. <br/> <s>It would be worth noting that not all sports allow consulting instant video replays. The use of this technology has turned into a debate among the officials and sports fans of soccer, with the officials refusing to make use of it as it could have serious impact on the specific aspects of associated football. However, instant replay is sometimes used for taking disciplinary decisions. The technology is officially used in football, basketball, field hockey, baseball, cricket and more.'),

Yes, you read it correct smart clothing, your shirt, your trousers and even your Gloves will be smart. Lets take a sneak peak at what future holds for us and what is already present for us to use. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>perfect example of next-generation wearable tech is Cityzen Sciencesâ€™ project, codename D-Shirt. Sensors which detect movement, heart rate, speed, breathing patterns, and GPS location are woven into the fabric of this high-tech shirt, which should go on sale in 2015 as both a top and a pair of cycling shorts. In development since 2012, itâ€™s not the shirt that makes this important, itâ€™s the fabric. By perfecting such a new forms of fabric, the technology that makes wristbands so popular may weave itself into our clothes. <br/> <s>â€œSmartshirts can hold more sensors closer to the skin,â€ explained Gartnerâ€™s research director to The Guardian. â€œThey can collect more information and produce better data, like the full wave of the heart beat rather than just the pulse.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Integrating technology into clothing doesnâ€™t have to be about measuring fitness. The Visijax Commuter Jacket uses technology to improve a cyclistâ€™s safety. A Teflon coating makes it waterproof, and all-round ventilation keeps the wearer cool, but this isnâ€™t the techy part. A rechargeable battery pack powers a set of white and red LED lights, and car-style indicators which activate automatically, even if the rider has both hands on the handlebars. The Visijax uses wearable technology to solve a very real problem, and one that is becoming more widespread in cities around the world. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The AMPL SmartBackpack shares a waterproof covering, and a removable battery pack, with the Visijax, but is designed for convenience. USB cables in each pocket charge gadgets stored in the backpack â€” from a phone to a laptop â€” and an app keeps you informed of levels. It also has the ability to adjust priority and sound an alert should the bag get left behind. Calling something smart isnâ€™t only about connecting it with a smartphone, itâ€™s also about smartly solving problems, and keeping gadgets topped up with energy is a constant issue. <br/> <s>Where tech and fashion begin to meet <br/> <s>LikeAGlove is one example. You order one basic piece of clothing from the company, but itâ€™s only supposed to be worn inside the house, because itâ€™s only for taking your exact measurements. Working with online stores, LikeAGlove will ensure the clothes you order online will fit you perfectly, taking away one of the biggest frustrations in shopping for clothes over the Internet: not being absolutely sure about sizing. The company told CNet that a production model should be ready for early 2015. <br/> <s>The fashion world is only now beginning to explore smart concepts, but we could start to see clothing with features similar to the Synapse Dress, in designs we could actually wear out on the street. Made using Intelâ€™s Edison chip, the wearer could control the built-in lighting system and video camera using their brainwaves. Smart clothing is as much about fun and creativity as safety, fitness, and convenience. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>These smart clothes arenâ€™t only for fashion-conscious adults either. The Exmobaby is a pair of smart pajamas for babies, containing a thermometer, movement sensors, and a special ECG monitor woven into the fabric. Itâ€™ll help parents keep an eye on the childâ€™s well-being, and cleverly uses an FM transmitter to send data to an external station, keeping any electronics at a safe distance. The station also doubles as a nightlight. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Tantalizingly close to reality <br/> <s>Smart clothing like Bowkerâ€™s wild designs and the Synapse Dress are only fit for fashion shows and runways, but as with most clothing trends, thatâ€™s where it all starts. Donâ€™t forget, Ralph Lauren has experimented with smart clothes; weâ€™ve tried on attention-grabbing LED screened t-shirts, and there are performance tracking bras already. Basic smart clothes are already here. <br/> <s>Thereâ€™s still plenty of work to be done, especially in the areas of battery power and miniaturization of hardware, before smart clothing hits the mainstream. However, we can already see smart fabrics, clothing, and inks are attracting attention from a very diverse crowd. Taking it out of the tech industryâ€™s hands means more variety, and a better chance weâ€™ll get something we actually want to wear everyday. If things work out as analysts expect, by the end of 2016, weâ€™ll buy more smart clothes than any other kind of wearable tech. This yearâ€™s CES might be the place where weâ€™ll get our first look at the trends tech fans will be wearing next year. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Reffer: http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/smart-clothing-garments-at-ces-2015-and-beyond/'),

Women will blame their PMS. Both sexes will blame their stress, their exhaustion, or their worries. Never mind that other people who have PMS or who are stressed, tired, or worried donâ€™t pop off at the world. Angry people donâ€™t yet understand that they are actually giving themselves permission to rant. In that sense, they are very much in control. <br/> <s> <s> <s> <br/> <s>2. The only way to express anger is to explode: <s><br/> <s> <s> People who rage believe that anger is like the buildup of steam in an overheated steam engine. They think they need to blow off the steam in order to be OK. In fact, raging tends only to produce more of the same. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Frustration is intolerable: <br/> <s> <s> Angry people canâ€™t sit with frustration, anxiety or fear. To them, such feelings are a signal that they are being challenged. When life doesnâ€™t go their way, when someone doesnâ€™t see things as they do, when their best-laid plans get interrupted or they make a mistake, they simply canâ€™t tolerate it. To them, itâ€™s better to blow than to be left with those feelings. They donâ€™t get it that frustration is a normal part of everyoneâ€™s life and that it is often the source of creativity and inspiration. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Itâ€™s more important to win than to be right: <s><br/> <s> <s>Chronically angry people often have the idea that their status is at stake when there is conflict. When questioned, they take it overly personally. If they are losing an argument, they experience a loss of self-esteem. At that moment, they need to assert their authority, even if they are wrong. When it is certain that they are wrong, they will find a way to prove that the other person is more wrong. For mature people, self-esteem is grounded in being able to put ego aside in order to find the best solution. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. â€œRespectâ€ means that people do things their way: <s><br/> <s> <s>When another driver tailgates, when a partner refuses to go along with a plan, when a kid doesnâ€™t jump when told to do something, they feel disrespected. To them, disrespect is intolerable. Making a lot of noise and threatening is their way of reasserting their right to â€œrespectâ€ by others. Sadly, when the basis of â€œrespectâ€ is fear, it takes a toll on love and caring. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. The way to make things right is to fight: <s><br/> <s> <s>Some angry people have learned at the feet of a master. Having grown up with parents who fight, it is their â€œnormal.â€ They havenâ€™t a clue how to negotiate differences or manage conflict except by escalating. Then they become very much like the parent they loathed and feared when they were kids. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7. Other people should understand that they didnâ€™t mean what they did or said when they were angry: <s><br/> <s> <s> Angry people feel that anger entitles them to let loose. Itâ€™s up to other people not to take seriously hurtful things they say or do. After all, they say, they were just angry. They donâ€™t get it that other people are legitimately hurt, embarrassed, humiliated, or afraid. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Source: http://psychcentral.com/lib/7-mistaken-assumptions-angry-people-make/00012480 '),

Over time, it will also become a common core network for packet-switched services in 2G and 3G networks, and potentially for Wi-Fi access. The EPC is central to the mobile network architecture and critical to the delivery of end-user services. It sits between the radio access network (RAN), the IP network, external services and a number of other network elements used to authenticate, secure and deliver services to end users. It is a strategic point of control in the delivery of mobile data services, as shown in the excerpt below. <s><br/> <s>All of the technology vendors are now on board with the concept of virtual EPC, and large vendors â€“ as well as a number of challengers â€“ now have plans to offer commercial product. In detail, however, there are significant differences between suppliers, both in approach and in timing. This report examines 11 leading EPC technology vendors, detailing their virtual EPC strategy, technology and timeline. <s><br/> <s>Many mobile core functions have been identified as good candidates for virtualization, and it is not unrealistic to think that an entire mobile core could be fully virtualized and operate at close to parity in performance and feature terms with traditional core network within three years. Feature parity could be achieved in a shorter time frame, and a <a>quot;good enough<a>quot; feature set even sooner.

There are good reasons to avoid 12 ascendants superstitions, such as regaining your own guardian angel. Gemini has been shifting towards the north of your horoscope over the past 5000 years: therefore, when they say you had a â€œGemini ascendantâ€, youâ€™ll find said twin stars at north instead. That only makes for 90 degrees of miscalculation. You wonâ€™t spot Gemini rising at east. So drop the 12. #QuarterSky #ZodiacShift #ZodiacFix #AcademicZodiac #AscendantShift #HGA #16ascendants guardian #angels <br/> <s>2)	Avoid 13. The number of zodiacal stations is 22. The ascendants are 16. Anyone can see them with naked eye. The Sun does not determine the zodiac: the planets do. And, by the way, Ophiuchus happens to be one of the 16 ascendants. #2016shift #Saturn in #Ophiuchus #Ofiuco 1622 <br/> <s>3)	#SunSigns are generally unimportant, however 16 by extension; including Orion, Cetus and Sextans. <br/> <s>4)	The lunar calendar may not be what they hold in their own hands at all: thus â€“ 9-11 has Moon in Orion. <s><br/> <s>5)	Venus sign may be important for you. Thus, in the year 2015, Venus enters Hydra â€“ compare it with e.g. your partnerâ€™s Mars in Cetus. #VenuSign #Venus in #Hydra #2015shift <s><br/> <s>6)	The #ZodiacShift is non-linear much as the #AscendantShift â€“ these have nothing to do with anything as expected in popular mind. The zodiac shift thus travels by precession towards fantastic seven signs of solar shift, while an example has been given as concern the ascendant shift already â€“ Gemini last rose at east 5000 years ago â€“ never since. As you can see; juggling with 13 or 12 signs is not only completely useless but dangerous for the material and spiritual progress of the person. <s><br/> <s>7)	Stay away from house system jugglers. Our house system works under the sea, on high altitudes and even in outer space. Others crack below Oslo. In order to avoid divorcing on account of pseudo-astrological advice, tend to mistrust house systems â€“ question them. Bankruptcy or even having the wrong organ cut-off reportedly happen due to large house misplacements. <s><br/> <s>8)	Stay wary whenever â€œtraditionâ€ is mentioned: its mention covers for an infinite array of asinine errors in blatant disregard of your true natal skies. <s><br/> <s>9)	Avoid Chiron. By all means run away from charlatans whose hallmarks are often Juno, Pallas, Vesta or Chiron. Just run. There are 1008 planets in your horoscope. #1008planets #DarkPlanets #DwarfPlanets #Centaur <br/> <s>10)	Did you know that predicting the future is about changing it? The next 9-11 will occur as unpredicted as ever, since people are kept from their true personal and national natal skies by a rabble of superstitious delayers. Astrology is about prediction: there are 5000 predicting techniques o go. Some of them are applicable in minutes. Why can a toddler â€“ the proverbial shoeshine boy - be trained in twenty minutes into accurate prediction, while the opposing â€œexpertâ€ canâ€™t â€“ in being busy posing as know-it-all.? You donâ€™t want to â€œknow it allâ€ after the event! Anyone can predict with minute accuracy â€“ by memory â€“ in seconds.

In order to solve this problem we introduced the Web people search.

The web people search engine after searching the name it will cluster the names based on name entity so that user can easily disambiguate to identifying the particular person. In this project we try to avoid the dominance of the person name by introducing the WePS. It also reduces the user time to select desired person.'),
(46, 'The Search engine give the results based on user query key word in this the clustering is done based on the user query key word only. So that it leads to ambiguity of the namesakes and user took large time to search desired person among the all pages provide by the search engine. In order to avoid this drawback we Introduces the Web people search in this search the searching is performed based on the user queried input <s><br/> <s>Â but clustering is based on the name entities. Here name entity is the word which frequently appeared in the web page based on this we performs the clusters. In this WePS we can reduce the number of pages and the user time based on this cluster. In WePS first user gives the query on the search engine after that the system searches <s><br/> <s>Â the top K web pages K= d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ..... (d 1 , d 2 , d 3 are web pages). Â  <br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Now we have to perform preprocessing web pages, clustering and post processing the web pages and finally results are based on name entities. For example the user searches for the name Johnson the System first collects web pages related to the Johnson after that it will preprocesses that web pages in that preprocess step includes the Extraction, Segmentation and Name entity filtering. In the extraction the system extract the data <s><br/> <s>Â related to the name like name entity, city name, e-mail id etc. after that if one page refers multiple name sacks it will perform segmentation to split into different web pages after that perform the filtering the web pages based on the name entities and finally result will be produced Johnson farmer, Johnson sportsman, Johnson politician <s><br/> <s>Â likewise the cluster web pages will display on screen so that the user selects the desired person without ambiguity so that user searching time also reduced. Bill Gates who is not founder of Microsoft <s><br/> <s>Â this query is very difficult to search in the search engine because most of the pages <s><br/> <s>Â irrelevant to that particular person. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â In order to solve these kinds of problems the Web People Search is introduced in this web people search it will return the cluster of pages for each individual name Bill Gate like Bill Gate politician, Bill Gate Microsoft founder and Bill Gate sport star so that user can easily identified which Bill Gate he want know. This task is quite simple for the user to search for the particular person in the web. For this purpose Web People Search uses the ER techniques the direct application of Entity Relationship techniques is that extract the extra information regarding like the name entities, n-grams and hyperlinks etc. In order to applying those ER techniques in practical there are some problems those are lake of information for each every person details to overcome these problems we consider some external resources like Wikipedia etc. One of the most powerful external resources is web only but the problem is how and what is the systematic procedure to obtaining the useful data from web. The search engine return pages referred as contextual entities and then define the inter relationships among the contextual entities in terms of web co-occurrence statistics these co-occurrence features are combined with the specialized approach that is skyline based approach. In this skyline based approach is used for deriving the external feature based similarities and the main purpose is entity resolution by considering the dominance that exists in co-occurrences of data. Now a dayâ€™s daily the Google search handle the ten million queries per day among those 5-10% queries based on web people search only. In web people search the users are searching for the particular person web pages surprisingly the latest search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bingo search <s><br/> <s>Â engines also gives the cluster of web pages regarding the that particular person. In that cluster of web pages not only having the information regarding to that querying person but also having different namesakes of information but user need to search his interesting person among that cluster of web pages this leads to the user ambiguity and it takes much time to search desired person among that cluster of web pages. Sometimes dominance problem also comes for example if people search for Bill Gates then most of the pages contains the information about the Bill gates who is the founder of Micro Soft in that case searching for person by name. <br/> <s><br/> The skyline based approach is for quality improvement over the all classification like decision tree classification etc the result of the skyline based classification aggregated with direct feature similarities which are helpful in the computing of the overall similarities of the web page pairs our <br/> approach is to increase the more direct features to increasing the overall similarity. If there are limited information about the particular web page then it performs the direct and indirect features in the clustering to improve quality of the clustering. '),
(47, 'The one of the most recently approach for web people search is exploiting querying for web people search in WePS-2 the over view of this existing solution is as follow. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. User input: The user types query on the Web People Search system to search about the particular person. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Top K retrieval: The system sends this information to the search engine and searches the information about the query and finally retrieves top K web pages. This step is done by the most of the search engines. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Pre processing: The preprocessing is performed on the top k web pages the preprocessing steps are as follows. <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> a).Extraction: The extraction is performed on the top K web pages this extraction is based on the name entity, location and hyperlink in order to extract these entities based on the existing extracting third party software. <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> b).Segmentation: If any web page refers the multiple namesakes then that web page will be spited into the two sub web pages like each namesake will be at single web page. <s><br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> c).Name entity filtering: Some name entities are too ambiguous that name entities remove from this web page. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Clustering: After performing the pre processing the web pages are clustered the clustering mechanism can follow the following steps. <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>a).TF/IDF similarity: The Term Frequency and the Inverse Document Frequency can be calculated to identify the similarity of the name entities in the web page. The TF/IDF can be calculated as follows. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For example there are 100 words in the document and 3 words are repeated the TF is calculated like 3/100=0.03 <br/> <s> <br/> <s>If there are 10000 documents and the word is repeated 100 times then IDF calculated as follows <s><br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> IDF = log(10000/100)=2. <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s>Now the TF/IDF is 2*0.03=0.06. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>b).querying the web: Several co-occurrence queries are formed for the each pair of web pages d 1 and d 2 . These queries are given to the web search engine to get more information about the similarity. <br/> <s> <s> <s><br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>c).Making pair wise decision: After calculation of the co-occurrences we need to decide which pages are similar to the each other for this there will be one mechanism called skyline based approach. This approach is based on the TF/IDF similarity the output of the skyline based approach is directly aggregated with direct feature <br/> <s>similarity to compute the overall similarity of the web pages. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>d).Applying clustering: There are two types of clustering can be perform either single link clustering or correlation clustering can be performed with output of skyline based classification web pages. The clustering is <br/> <s>nothing but combining the web pages this clustering procedure can be explained clearly. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>e).Post processing: In the post processing step the data can segmented and filtered and finally the post processing steps are as follows <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s>1.

As professional web design has evolved, and roles and responsibilities have advanced and divided, the professional web design community has had to find ways to differentiate itself from so many entering the field as amateurs, claiming the Web Designer moniker, and as web software programs began to democratize web production. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Ref: http://uxdesign.com/about-user-experience-design/article/what-is-ux/4');

According to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the new compound, christened CASPOL, is a water-based ready-to-coat and easy-to-use flameproof coating, with excellent flame retardant, waterproofing and thermal control properties. <a>quot;It can be applied on walls, clothes, paper, thatched roofs and wood to protect them from fire,<a>quot; the space agency said Monday in a statement. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>CASPOL, which contains no toxic materials, is eco-friendly. <a>quot;The emulsion can be sprayed or spread using a brush on surfaces that need fire protection. One litre of CASPOL can coat 1.5 sq metre with a thickness of 500 micron, which is practically adequate for fire protection and thermal insulation,<a>quot; the statement said. It can also be used as a flame retardant material in railways and automobiles where the seat cushions can be made flameproof without affecting the cushioning characteristics. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Shopping malls and theatres can be easily rendered fire resistant by using CASPOL in their seat cushions and walls. CASPOL can also be applied over the concrete surfaces of buildings to prevent water seeping as its application fills micro cracks and holes effectively.

Like the award-winning 4C Coupe, the all-new 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider model<r>s designation is a return to <a>quot;the great Alfa Romeos<a>quot; and continues this tradition with the innovative all-aluminum 1750 cc turbocharged direct injection, dual intercooler four-cylinder engine, delivering an impressive 136 horsepower-per-liter. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>With seating for two, panoramic views and the soundtrack of an Italian performance-tuned engine and exhaust, Spiders are among the most exhilarating experiences in motoring - and represent the very core of Alfa Romeo<r>s DNA and heritage. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The 4C Spider draws from a bloodline that includes some of the most purpose-built performance models that illustrate lightness and efficiency with undeniable Alfa Romeo style: the aluminum-bodied 8C 2900 B Touring (1938); the 1900 C52 <a>quot;Flying Saucer<a>quot; (1952), which could exceed 140 mph (230 kph); and most notably the legendary 33 Stradale (1967) with its mid-engine and magnesium alloy and steel tube chassis <a>quot;clothed<a>quot; by groundbreaking styling, which is functional and distinctly Italian. And now it is the 4C Spider<r>s turn to deliver the driving thrill, performance and unforgettable emotion that only an Alfa Romeo Spider provokes. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Groundbreaking and seductive Italian style <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Continuing the groundbreaking theme of technology, performance and Italian style, the all-new 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider builds upon the brand<r>s journey, which was embarked upon with the 8C Competizione (2008), 8C Spider (2009), 4C Coupe (2015), and most recently, the 4C Spider Concept, which debuted at the 84th International Geneva Motor Show. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Inspired by the 33 Stradale, the all-new Alfa Romeo 4C Spider transcends this legendary racecar<r>s mid-engine body forms and follows its purposeful and lightweight performance tradition with sheet-molded compound (SMC) composite panels forming its seductive Italian design, and <a>quot;clothing<a>quot; its state-of-the-art carbon fiber monocoque chassis and all-aluminum 1750 cc turbocharged, direct-injected engine. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Covering the <a>quot;beating heart<a>quot; of this Italian supercar is a deck-lid with three functional heat extractors and an aerodynamically tuned spoiler. And it<r>s from the 4C Spider<r>s <a>quot;beating heart<a>quot; where every other design element starts: two muscular forms straddle the rear hood and elevate the body above the cockpit<r>s beltline for visual strength and foundation for the black or available carbon fiber <a>quot;halo.<a>quot; The rear fascia and round rear LED illuminated taillamps blend into the muscular rear wings for a powerful stance, while stylistically incorporating large functional air intakes to cool the engine. Below, dual exhausts are mounted at the corners and highlight the 4C Spider<r>s supercar stance. Inspired by the 4C Spider Concept, an all-new, Akrapovic dual-mode center-mounted performance exhaust system will be available on the 4C Spider (late availability). <br/> <s> <br/> <s>On each side of the all-new 4C Spider, the sculpted air intakes spring a muscular and dynamic form that lead elegantly into the headlamps.

Together with the two side air intakes designed in the front fascia, the 4C Spider forms the famous <a>quot;Trilobo,<a>quot; a significant facet of Alfa Romeo<r>s distinctive design. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Performance-focused cockpit <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The all-new 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider<r>s cockpit is inspired from racing, purpose built with only the essential driving components stylistically integrated. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The Alfa Romeo 4C Spider features two composite-framed sport seats with standard leather and an exposed carbon fiber monocoque that exemplifies its race-inspired technologies. Furthermore, a driver-oriented cockpit with flat-bottom, leather performance steering wheel with paddle-shifters and aluminum pedals speak to the brand<r>s racing spirit. For an upscale look, the fully wrapped premium-leather interior with accent stitching is standard on the Alfa Romeo 4C Spider, as are unique carbon fiber vent surrounds. Highlighting the use of advanced technology is a 7-inch full-color driver information display (DID) cluster, which displays vehicle information through high-impact graphics to keep the driver focused on the road, or track, ahead.'),

Have a look on startup mistakes, you should avoid. <s><br/> <s>Â Below you will find the 18 startup mistakes: <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â #1. Single Founder: As a single founder you have almost zero chance of getting funding from Paul Graham. Why? Itâ€™s not a coincidence, he says, that founders who succeeded did so as a team of at least two. <s><br/> <s>Â #2. Bad Location â€“ you can change everything about a house but its location. Likewise, if your startup is in a bad location, you canâ€™t change the nature of that location. Itâ€™s easier to move the startup. Where to? Silicon Valley. <s><br/> <s>Â #3. Marginal Niche â€“ by choosing an obscure niche a startup may paint themselves in a corner. If you are afraid of competition, this is not the way to avoid it. <s><br/> <s>Â #4. Derivative Idea â€“ there are only so many Twitters for pet owners one can come up with. The bottom line is that the Google of tomorrow will not be like Google. <s><br/> <s>Â #5. Obstinacy â€“ or inability to adapt kills startups who would have survived had they not been too stubborn to see what their users were telling them. <s><br/> <s>Â #6. Hiring Bad Programmers â€“ knowing a good programmer from a bad one often takes being a good one yourself, or having a trusted one on your team. Exceptional programmers are always in short supply. So the odds are stacked up against hiring good ones. <s><br/> <s>Â #7. Choosing the Wrong Platform â€“ how fast you can scale will determine whether your startup lives or dies once you get traction. On the wrong platform scalability will be the bottleneck. And users often donâ€™t wait for you to figure it out. <s><br/> <s>Â  #8. Slowness in Launching â€“ before you actually launch you are in the dark about whether your startup should even exist. The longer you delay the launch the more you delay getting the answer. If you are afraid to know what the answer is, you might want to ask yourself why. <s><br/> <s>Â #9. Launching Too Early â€“ launch too early, though, and you may be completely unprepared to handle your growth, or worse yet to present a usable product. <s><br/> <s>Â #10. Having No Specific User in Mind â€“ somewhere someone will for sure be interested in your product, you just donâ€™t know who yet? Sounds like those people may not exist. Be sure to check. <s><br/> <s>Â #11. Raising Too Little Money â€“ you get what you spend on. With too little money you may not be able to flesh out your product in to its full potential. <s><br/> <s>Â #12. Spending Too Much â€“ spending too much before you grew enough to have the numbers to raise the next round, and you are out of cash, which often spells the end. <s><br/> <s>Â #13. Raising Too Much Money â€“ raising too much will likely make you feel like a huge success even before you made anything useful. At the end of the day itâ€™s users, not investors, you want to impress the most. <s><br/> <s>Â #14. Poor Investor Management â€“ if the choice is between making investors happy or making your users happy, always choose the users. If the user is happy your investors will make money eventually. <s><br/> <s>Â #15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit â€“ you can always make money later. This however, cannot be said about making users happy. You need to make something they want now. <s><br/> <s>Â #16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty â€“ you canâ€™t solve all your problems with coding. Businesses are built on relationships. Go out and meet those people. <s><br/> <s>Â #17. Fights Between Founders â€“ founder conflict is too common. Founders being ambitious people are almost bound to disagree. <s><br/> <s>Â #18. A Half-Hearted Effort â€“ a lack of determination to see the startup through to the end is not rare. If you feel like you have other options in life than building your startup, you will probably mentally hang on to them. <s><br/> <s>Â For more information check out at : http://goo.gl/PxoOx1 <s><br/> <s>Â Ref: http://goo.gl/5h5zsh'),

Then print, print and print some more. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Already, some companies are figuring out how to print cells as the first step in creating a new organ for transplanting into people. One company has just printed most of a working electric car. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In a few years, 3-D printing could drastically change the world of manufacturing. Already, creative people -they call themselves makers - have formed communities to share computer files that give the directions for making their novel creations <br/> <s> <br/> <s>According to legend, the French sculptor Auguste Rodin once explained: â€œI choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I donâ€™t need.â€ This means he used subtraction to sculpt his creations. 3-D printing does the opposite: It adds layers, one at a time, to build something from the bottom up. Thatâ€™s why some engineers refer to 3-D printing as additive manufacturing. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For 3-D printing, someone must create a computer file that describes a desired object in three dimensions. This blueprint includes the size, shape and color of the thing to be printed. Then someone tells the computer to digitally â€œsliceâ€ that object into virtual slivers. The printer then builds each slice, one thin layer at a time. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Some printers spit out metal. Others spray a liquid that will harden into plastic. Some manufacturers are using special printers to spray out chocolate, cheese or other foods to make custom products. In 2013, one biomedical research company used plastic to 3-D print 75 percent of a manâ€™s skull, which was then surgically implanted into the patient. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The European Space Agency has begun research to see if it can â€œprintâ€ a moon base using lunar soil. NASA, the American space agency, is investigating the idea of using 3-D printing to create food for astronauts on deep-space missions. <br/> <s>Reference: http://goo.gl/gFyu97 <br/> <s>Author Information: http://goo.gl/ce8Ryg'),

We have witnessed numerous innovations in the world of technology in this year. However, the evolution process of technology is slow. The incremental changes in technology are occasional. Letâ€™s take a look at 5 tech trends for 2015. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 1. Big Data: Big Data development is tremendous and unstoppable. We are generating tremendous amount of data. Eric Schmidt, Chairman of Google had said, we generate five exabytes of data every two days. He had made the statement in 2010. The number must have doubled by now. We are capturing data through mobile apps, sensors, websites and this rate is expected regularly in 2015 too. <s><br/> <s>Â Companies like IBM, Intel are expected to come up with powerful decision making tools to analyse this piles of data in 2015. IBM is working on a super computer project that can introduce cognitive computing to all industries. IBM is also working another project using Twitterâ€™s data. Intel is building hardware platform for enterprises to bring Big Data processing. The rate of development in this data is expected to increase exponentially in 2015. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 2. Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence can true bring the data revolution. Microsoft is using machine learning to analyse speech and conversations. Skypeâ€™s new Translator app can perform real-time, bidirectional translations. The company is working on a feature that can even mimic the accept of other languages. <s><br/> <s>Â Eugene Groostman beat proved the quality in Turing test this year. This research can lead to building human like thought system processor in future. Demis Hassabis from Google is trying to solve intelligence using his startup, DeepMind. It is a recreating human neurons in silicon and code. Artificial intelligence certainly has a great potential to grow and nurture in 2015. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 3. Robots: We will get to see futuristic version of robots in 2015. These futuristic robots can be used in manufacturing industry. Interactive Robotics Group team at MIT is working pretty hard on manufacturing robots that can work on assembly line. Most of these robots will work in highly controlled environment, away from human beings. <s><br/> <s>Â Amazon is working on Rabo-Stow robotic arms that can pick things from shelves. And the mobile can control the things in the factory. Personal robots like Jibo and Pepper are great example of what the future with robots in day-to-day life is going to look like. MIT professor, Sangbae Kimâ€™s Cheeta robot can run really fast. He looks at his model has futuristic driverless car. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 4. Batteries: Most consumer manufacturing companies are working on future battery technology. Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and Texas instruments are building on more efficient mobile CPUs that can consume minimal battery power. The chemical science will have a major breakthrough in coming year. <s><br/> <s>Â Scientists are working on sodium-based, complex hydride. It can lead to cheaper and more efficient battery power. Applied Material research will lead to advance solid state battery technology which can hold much more power than traditional lithium ion battery. New battery technology will have distinct possibilities. Wireless charging was introduced in 2013 but, we will see major advances in wireless charging in 2015. We just need more wireless charging gadgets, charging stations. All such gadgets will probably flood the markets in coming year. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 5. Flexible Displays: We can finally expect to see the flexible displays in 2015. Curved display products like LGâ€™s curved HDTV, Samsung Gear Git have been launched in this year. However electronic gadgets with proper flexible displays have been a dream product. We can expect to see thin and flexible displays in coming year. <s><br/> <s>Â Intel is reportedly working on a product with drinking components and removable wires through WiDi (Wireless Display) technology. The potential of flexible display products is tremendous. This can be a great innovation for biometric password tools, smart home and internet of things. Flexible displays can also be used in wearable gadgets. <s><br/> <s>Â Content from efytimes <s><br/> <s>Â More from author: http://azure.efytimes.com/?author=2'),

Many tech companies are seen adopting to open source technologies lately. Even government agencies are replacing proprietary software with open source. Most of the open source projects are backed by strong active community of developers. <br/> <s>Some open source projects have really high potential. As a developer, it is important that you give back something to the open source community. Here is a list of five high-potential startups that you should look forward to join in 2015. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. BRL-CAD: <br/> <s>BRL-CAD is a powerful and dynamic 3D modeling system. This can be very helpful for coders, testers and even trainers and professional UI designers. The code is available online but, it is quite complex. If you are a programmer, you can help in cleaning up the code. There are numerous tasks that you can do to help BRL-CAD project. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Speed Dreams: <br/> <s>Speed Dreams is a 3D motorsport simulation and racing game. The project supports Windows and Linux, the Mac OS version is still under development. The lead developers team is looking for developers, designers and people to write documentation. If you are a gamer, you can join Speed Dreams as the community shares same passion for gaming and open source. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. OpenMRS: <br/> <s>OpenMRS is a software project that actually helps people. The platform mainly focuses on healthcare sector. The project is looking for programmers, testers, IT support, technical writers, UI designers and translators. You can join the OpenMRS community and discuss ideas, suggest new features, fix bugs or even promote the project on social media. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Audacity: <br/> <s>Audacity is a popular sound recording and editing software. The software has been around since May 2000 and is constantly improving. Audacity is looking for range of contributors. Developers, testers, script writers, anyone can help the project to grow and develop. If you are good with language, you can help in writing the documentation of the project too. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. FLOSS Manuals: <br/> <s>FLOSS Manuals, as the name suggests, is the library of software and open source manuals. The project doesn<r>t need designers or testers. It needs writers. If you think you are good with words, you can definitely help in the development of FLOSS Manuals. Best thing about FLOSS Manuals is you don<r>t have to jump right in and start from scratch.

With the constraint budgets, it becomes even tougher to find a decent programming staff that meets your expectations. The hiring process becomes more complex because screening the programmer by his skill set involves computer tests. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Big companies offer large paychecks to lure talented programmers, it becomes hard for small start-ups and small enterprises to find the talent in such cases. There are certain requirements a programmer has to meet in order to work efficiently. Today we have listed 10 characteristics that every programmer has. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. Technical Skills: <s> One common mistakes HR executive does while hiring a programmer is looking at programming experience. Instead of requiring minimum 3 years of C   programming experience, a hiring team should look for a person who has added more number of new programming languages to his resume in recent times. You can simply check this by asking for their experience with different programming languages. Always look at the bigger picture. Older programming languages are no more used or practiced in the industry. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Learning Curve: <s> Technology is always evolving. It is a never ending process. You must look for a person who is willing to learn new languages. The current programming knowledge of a person is going to get outdated in few years. It is important to know if programer has interest in learning new languages with the advances and development in technology. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Debugging: <s>Debugging is equally important as creating a code. A programmer can get to the root of the problem quickly only if he has nice debugging skills. Always hire the programmer who can investigate his own code and research the possible loopholes. If a programmer can handle the bugs in his own code then he is the right person for the job. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>â€¨4. Work Environment: <s> Some programmers need complete silence while they are coding. Whereas, some prefer to work in chaos. Personal preferences of programmers affect their work ability to a great extent. It is important that programmers stay productive most of their time. Their productivity reflects in the quality of the work. Hiring team should always ask the programmer about his ideal work environment. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. Problem Solving Skills: <s>Creating an application is addressing to a particular problem. It is important to check the problem solving skill of candidate applying for programmerâ€™s job. Programming can be compared with difficult math question. A good programmer always thrives on finding new ways to make something work. Every time you are trying to implement new ideas, you dont want to hear â€˜that canâ€™t be done.â€™ You should always ask a programmer if he can create a new task for your organisation. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. Passion: <s>Some programmers are working for the sake of making living while some are coding because of their love for coding. It is important to know the level of passion of programmer. The passion for programming reflects in dedication and ultimately the result. True programmers are typical computer geeks who spend most of their time in building or breaking stuff. Even though the passion is not necessary, it does reflect in work. You should ask your candidates about their hobbies or favorite pass time. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7. Communication Skills: <s>It is obvious that programmers are not the best at talking to people. But in some cases programmers need to interact with their managers, co-wokers and clients. Their ability to communicate and interact matters a lot in client or team meetings. You can test the people skills of programmers in various ways. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>8. Laziness: <s>Laziness may sound like a bad thing to most of the people but when it comes to programmers, it is the advantage. Good programmers often have lazy approach. Statistics and research proves that laziness, impatience and hubris are the ideal qualities for programmers. Statistics show that lazy person finds the quickest and most efficient way to solve a programming problem.'),

It is named as <a>quot;Punjabi suit<a>quot; or simply <a>quot;shalwar<a>quot; in the north and <a>quot;churidaar<a>quot; in Southern India. Women generally wear a dupatta or odani (Veil) with salwar kameez to cover their head and shoulders. It is always worn with a scarf called a dupatta, which is used to cover the head and drawn over the bosom. The material for the dupatta usually depends upon that of the suit, and is generally of cotton, georgette, silk, chiffon among others.This dress is worn by almost every teenage girl in lieu of western clothes.

In reply, Trai said the suggested reserve price for 2,100-MHz spectrum remained unchanged. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Trai had recommended a base price of Rs 2,720 crore for each MHz of 2,100-MHz spectrum, while an internal committee of DoT was of the view that it should be over Rs 3,800 crore, on the basis of prices in the previous round of 3G spectrum auction in 2010. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Now, a final decision on the base price is likely to be taken at a meeting of the Telecom Commission, scheduled for January 19. The decision will next week be sent to the Cabinet for approval. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Trai also came down heavily on the governmentâ€™s decision to auction only 5 MHz of 2,100-MHz spectrum in February. <s><br/> <s>â€œThe whole purpose of clubbing 2,100-MHz band spectrum with other bands for auction in February this year will be defeated if sufficient spectrum is not made available. Spreading the auction of 2,100-MHz spectrum over two rounds - first in February and the second in December, after the defense services vacate airwaves would squeeze supply in the February auction, and artificially increase market price,â€ the regulator said in its clarifications/reconsideration of recommendations on â€˜valuation and reserve price of spectrum: 2,100-MHz band. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The 15 MHz of 2,100-MHz airwaves being vacated by the defence services should be auctioned, in view of the in-principle agreement reached with the defence ministry, Trai said. Also, no bidder should be permitted to bid for more than two blocks in 2,100-MHz band in a service area where three-four blocks were available, it suggested. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The regulator said it was DoTâ€™s responsibility to either ensure the spectrum being auctioned was interference-free, or share information upfront about the areas where interference was likely, so that telecom service providers could take informed decisions while participating in the auction. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>IT <a>amp; communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said the government will auction only 5 MHz of 2,100-MHz airwaves in February, along with the 800-MHz, 900-MHz and 1,800-Mhz bands. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>He had earlier said vacation of 15 MHz of spectrum by the defence services through a swapping arrangement was yet to be completed, so the government was not in a position to auction more in February. <br/> <s>Reference: http://goo.gl/z2s6Ik'),

The utilities in the industrialized countries are today in a period of change and agitation. On one hand, large parts of the power grid infrastructure are reaching their designed end of life time, since a large portion of the equipment was installed in the 1960s. On the other hand, there is a strong political and regulatory push for more competition and lower energy prices, more energy efficiency and an increased use of renewable energy like solar, wind, biomasses and water. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In industrialized countries, the load demand has decreased or remained constant in the previous decade, whereas developing countries have shown a rapidly increasing load demand. Aging equipment, dispersed generation as well as load increase might lead to highly utilized equipment during peak load conditions. If the upgrade of the power grid should be reduced to a minimum, new ways of operating power systems need to be found and established. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In many countries, regulators and liberalization are forcing utilities to reduce costs for the transmission and distribution of electrical energy. Therefore, new methods (mainly based on the efforts of modern information and communication techniques) to operate power systems are required to guarantee a sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The general goals of Smart Grid are to ensure a transparent, sustainable and environmental-friendly system operation that is cost and energy efficient, secure and safe. Objectives of developing the Smart Grid are quite different from country to country for their various demands and start points.

Embrace the Cloud: <s><br/> <s>Â IT organizations have to become comfortable working with a variety of public and private cloud services. Deploying IoT solutions doesn<r>t make economic sense unless they employ low-cost, highly scalable cloud services to ensure economical connectivity, compute power and storage capabilities. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 2. Get a Grip on Security: <s><br/> <s>Â IT organizations must become intimately familiar with the real versus perceived security risks associated with an increasingly connected world. They also must recognize their limitations in combating the security risks on their own, and identify third-party skills and resources that can augment their in-house security capabilities. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 3. Study the Supply Chain: <s><br/> <s>Â IT organizations must become aware of the integration issues associated with IoT.

Utilising cloud services for business has allowed for companies to scale, drive IT costs down and become a more agile, streamlined business. <br/> <s>There are a few steps that should be taken by any company before they decide to make the switch across the cloud. <br/> <s>Utilising cloud services allows companies to scale, drive IT costs down and become more agile. However to keep cloud usage in check and systems running smoothly there are a number of factors that should be considered: <br/> <s>1) Assess what business infrastructure can be outsourced. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Before considering the cloud, check youâ€™re sure what business infrastructure, processes and systems youâ€™re willing to outsource. Whether its email exchange or data storage, having an on premise solution gives you direct control so in the event of downtime you are able to act. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2) Calculate the savings. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>When it comes to justifying the cost of implementing cloud services itâ€™s crucial to be sure youâ€™re going to make a saving. Replacing and maintaining hardware can be a costly expenditure and the cloud can reduce a large amount of hardware costs, however Cloud based services need licences and the cost of multiple licences can quickly mount up <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3) Be aware of compliance issues. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>When data is moved between an internal network and cloud storage it is important to know how the data is going to be stored and secured. Laws such as the UKâ€™s Data Protection Act protects personal information from misuse while the US has Sarbanes-Oxley which all publicly traded companies must comply with , covering all financial systems and forcing SSL encryption policies upon finance departments. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4) Understand the differences between the private, public and hybrid cloud. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>There are a few key distinctions on the differences between differing cloud types. A public cloud is just that, public, SaaS providers utilise a public cloud to offer their services. A private cloud is hosted internally to employees and gives a high level of security. A hybrid cloud allows for the most effective deployment, such as a business using public cloud computing resources to scale quicker. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5) Get an SLA with your cloud provider. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Downtime affects everyone but having a service level agreement with a cloud hosting company can make sure that if downtime does happen, your business is up and running as quickly as possible. Applications that are migrated onto the cloud are expected to perform at the same level as dedicated hardware, if not perform better, so an SLA is key to keeping performance maximised. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6) Create Cloud policies. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Policies for how the cloud should be used within a company are important to make resources are used correctly, whether it is data storage, file or shared web services. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7) Be aware of all the security implications. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The cloud has security implications that need to be addressed. Endpoint security can be put in place that monitors information as it travels outside of an organisation to reduce the risk of data leakage. Heavy fines can be levied against data leaks so itâ€™s important to take the appropriate measures to reduce the risk. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>8) Monitor usage of the cloud and the cloud itself. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Depending what your main use of the cloud is, whether itâ€™s public or private, itâ€™s important to monitor both the status of the implementation as well as monitoring the usage that it is experiencing. Monitoring can give you greater insight into what is happening on the network and allows you to foresee any future issues or trends, such as downtime or server latency. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>9) Manage users and manage licenses. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The cloud brings with it a whole host of issues surrounding users, from multiple logins for several different SaaS platforms to individual licensing management. Making sure that licenses are used effectively across teams is an important step to making the most effective use of the cloud. Management tools that allow for single sign on are a worthy investment but come with additional risks that should be taken into consideration. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>10) Keep up-to-date with changes and improvements from providers. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>SaaS providers are now in a race to the top, functionality that used to be done through a physical update can now be launched across the network giving the user the latest and greatest functionality immediately. Keeping up with these changes can make sure youâ€™re using your cloud based applications to the best of their ability. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>While there is no silver bullet to make the most from the cloud, these are some of the ways you can make it easier during implementation, deployment and usage for your business. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This article was written by Brian King, Digital Marketing Manager at Opsview, a leading network performance monitoring company. <br/> <s>Reference: http://goo.gl/O20RvY'),

The device, called an endoscope, helps detect cancer and other illnesses. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>It may soon serve another purpose: zapping tumors. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The biomedical advancement, which is under development at the University at Buffalo, could make chemotherapy more efficient, reduce its side effects and improve how doctors treat some of the most deadly forms of cancer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;We are developing a novel endoscopic device that will improve our ability to detect and destroy cancer cells,<a>quot; says Ulas Sunar, PhD, a research assistant professor in UB<r>s Department of Biomedical Engineering and the principal investigator of a National Institutes of Health grant that supports the research. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Conventional endoscopic imaging has limitations. Its image contrast is distorted because light scatters and is absorbed by the body. This leads to blurred or low-contrast images of the tumor environment that limit doctors<r> ability to visualize tumors. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>To overcome these deficiencies, the new endoscope utilizes spatial frequency domain imaging. This new technique corrects the image contrast problem by projecting patterns of light at different frequencies on the cancer cells. This results in a high-contrast map of the tumor environment. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;We expect doctors in the operating room will greatly benefit from this device,<a>quot; Sunar says. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The next step is to zap the tumors. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Chemotherapy drugs will be delivered intravenously. But unlike conventional treatment, the drugs will be encapsulated in tiny liposomes called nanoballoons. This technology - under development by Jonathan Lovell, PhD, UB assistant professor of biomedical engineering - carries the drugs to the tumor while shielding them from healthy cells, thus reducing side effects. Upon reaching the cancer cells, doctors strike the nanoballons with the endoscopic light beam, causing them to pop open and release the drug directly at the tumor. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>To effectively target the nanoballoons, doctors need to control the light beam. Sunar is developing a <a>quot;digital mask<a>quot; that adjusts the beam<r>s intensity as well as manipulates its shape down to micron (one millionth of a meter) precision using a computer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;The mask is sort of like the Bat signal from Batman movies.

Its muzzle velocity is 910 m/s. Its effective range is 600 m. Its fed on 30 box magazine and supports various optics. It is basically a shorter and a lighter version of M16. It is good for close quarter fight due to its smaller barrel. A stand can also be attached and a grenade launcher too. It is going to replace M16 in US military. In the initial stages of M4 there were some problems but they were fixed up by colt. Initially M4 had flattened telescoping stock but now it has been made a little curvaceous. It is adequate weapon for majority of troops and its price is also acceptable. It makes it ideal for CQB. It is adopted by 20 other countries like Australia, Colombia, Canada, India etc. The individual owners can take it only under special circumstances. Its remarkable accuracy and firepower make it the perfect assault rifle.'),

This list would be helpful to web developer in confusing of choosing popular web font. Let<r>s check list of fonts on to the top ten <br/> <s> <br/> <s>10) Caslon <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Apparently the old typesetterâ€™s saying of â€œWhen in doubt, use Caslonâ€ applies to the web as well. The various revivals of William Caslonâ€™s work from the 18th century continue to be popular in the digital world of the 21st century. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>10 sites using Caslon in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/caslon <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Caslon â†’ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-caslon/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>9) LL Circular <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This geometric sans from Lineto really took off in 2014 thanks to its prominent use in a few big rebrandings from companies like Airbnb and Mint. I think it brings a touch of freshness to the geometric sans genre without deviating too much into unfamiliar territory. Laurenz Brunnerâ€™s other well-known typeface, Akkurat, has been a favorite of designers for years and Iâ€™m sure LL Circular will be as well. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>11 sites using LL Circular in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/circular <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get LL Circular â†’ http://lineto.com/The Fonts/Font Categories/Text Fonts/Circular/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>8) Gotham <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In 2014, Hoefler <a>amp; Coâ€™s Cloud.typography service finally started to see more widespread usage. Although their flagship typeface Gotham was one of the most used web fonts of the year, their other offerings such as Sentinel, Whitney and Archer have been quite popular as well. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>11 sites using Gotham in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/gotham <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Gotham â†’ http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7) GT Walsheim <br/> <s> <br/> <s>GT Walsheim, from Swiss foundry Grilli Type, is similar to other geometric sans such as LL Circular, but isnâ€™t afraid to bring on the quirks. The horizontally protruding bar on the â€œGâ€ and the curvy tail on the â€œyâ€ give it a distinctive look that adds a bit of warmth and friendliness to a geometric typeface that could otherwise feel cold and sterile. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>11 sites using GT Walsheim in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/gt-walsheim <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get GT Walsheim â†’ http://grillitype.com/typefaces/gt-walsheim <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6) Franklin Gothic <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Franklin Gothic has a long history as a classic editorial typeface in print, so Iâ€™m glad to see it used more for editorial purposes on the web, like on Time Magazineâ€™s site. Itâ€™s also a noted favorite font of â€œthe Godfather of the webâ€, Jeffrey Zeldman, so itâ€™s fitting that it makes the list of the most popular web fonts of the year. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>12 sites using Franklin Gothic in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/franklin-gothic <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Franklin Gothic â†’ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/franklin-gothic/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5) Proxima Nova <br/> <s> <br/> <s>On last yearâ€™s top ten list, I predicted that Proxima Nova would fall out of style for 2014. I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong. This typeface continues to be a staple on the web. I think due to its ubiquity itâ€™s starting to feel almost anonymous, like Helvetica, where it can be used for any type of design and fit right in. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>16 sites using Proxima Nova in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/proxima-nova <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Proxima Nova â†’ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4) Apercu <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Apercu was #2 on last yearâ€™s list and I predicted it would start to feel a little played out in 2014 due to it being used absolutely everywhere. Of course â€œplayed outâ€ is entirely subjective, but I feel like this prediction rings true. It could easily have reached #1 on this list, however, I personally started to not feature sites using it as they all seemed to be carbon copies of each other. If you use Apercu, will users of your site think the font is overused? Probably not, so donâ€™t let its popularity stop you from using it. But to someone who looks at type all day long it no longer feels fresh and exciting. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>17 sites using Apercu in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/apercu <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Apercu â†’ http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu/about-font <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3) Avenir <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Adrian Frutiger considered Avenir his finest work and this typeface has other admirers as well â€” I published a survey in April of last year where I asked 41 influential designers to list their three favorite typefaces and Avenir was mentioned the most. It doesnâ€™t feel â€œtrendyâ€ like some other typefaces on this list can tend to feel; it instead has a timeless quality that I believe will make it popular for years to come. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>19 sites using Avenir in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/avenir <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Avenir â†’ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2) Futura <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Speaking of timeless typefaces, Futura has seen widespread usage since it was released in 1927 and it continues to be popular on the web. Although it has a classic look, itâ€™s not the most readable of typefaces due to its low x-height. It may be worth checking out some alternatives to Futura if you are in need of something more flexible. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>20 sites using Futura in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/futura <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Futura â†’ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1) Brandon Grotesque <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Itâ€™s no surprise to anyone who follows type that Brandon Grotesque made it to #1 on this list. Last year I complained that too many sites were using it where the typeface felt a little out of place for their brand. Media Temple, a web hosting company, switched to Brandon Grotesque earlier this year for all of their branding. To me it feels odd seeing a tech company branding themselves with a typeface that has roots in architectural lettering of the 1920s. The typeface used to have a certain â€œfeelâ€ to it, to me at least, but that feeling is starting to become lost due to it being used everywhere, for every conceivable type of brand. But of course these kinds of feelings are subjective and typography and culture are always shifting and changing-typefaces will always have different connotations to different people. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>21 sites using Brandon Grotesque in 2014 â†’ http://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/brandon-grotesque <br/> <s> <s> <s>Where to get Brandon Grotesque â†’ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For more info with web fonts http://goo.gl/qagAOv');

Microsoft, Google says, replied that it was on track to fix the problem by February. Google said its 90-day deadline wasnâ€™t negotiable. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Part of why Microsoft bristled at this release: The company told Google it was now planning to fix the flaw as part of its regular â€œpatch Tuesdayâ€ slate of software updates, said Chris Betz, senior director of Microsoftâ€™s Security Response Center, in a blog post. Google didnâ€™t budge. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>â€œAlthough following through keeps to Googleâ€™s announced timeline for disclosure, the decision feels less like principles and more like a â€˜gotcha,â€™ with customers the ones who may suffer as a result,â€ Betz said. â€œWhatâ€™s right for Google is not always right for customers. We urge Google to make protection of customers our collective primary goal.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Googleâ€™s supporters argue that setting firm deadlines helps spur action by companies like Microsoft, particularly when flaws are live and potentially already exploited by folks with bad intentions. Thereâ€™s a lengthy debate about the policy on Googleâ€™s December post revealing the earlier Windows flaw. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Google, which didnâ€™t respond to requests for comment, is not without its own recent security issues. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>A researcher looking into a bug in an older version of the companyâ€™s popular Android operating system was told that the company would not be patching the flaw.

You Bet It Is. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>While being bombarded by promises for a new technology â€“ especially one as radical as SDN â€“ itâ€™s natural for IT executives to ask a simple question: How real is it? Whoâ€™s using it? How are they using it? What benefit are they deriving from it? <br/> <s>No question, SDN is in its early stages. But it already has an impressive list of household names, telecommunications carriers, and academic networks among its adherents. Hereâ€™s some of its early adopters: <br/> <s>Facebook. Earlier this month, social media behemoth Facebook revealed more details about the SDN deployment at its new Altoona, Pa., facility, described by Jonathan Vanian on GigaOm. â€œWhile it might be common for people to think that sending a query to Facebook is not a data-intensive task, once the information hits a data center that query actually multiplies as it ricochets to and from various Facebook machines. Because of this multiplier effect, Facebook has to make sure it can account for all that inter-data-center traffic and ensure its system doesnâ€™t slow down as it handles billions of user requests.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>To address these issues, Facebook transformed what were once physical clusters into virtual clusters, a strategy that reduces the number of physical devices necessary and increases the flexibility of the network. Is there a â€œlikeâ€ button for this? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Goldman Sachs. Financial services companies have always been on the forefront of technology, simply because the faster they can make trades, the more likely they are to make money. As Marcia Savage noted in Network Computing earlier this year in her coverage of the Open Networking Summit, â€œWith a complex environment of specialized networks, Goldman Sachs is eager to reap the efficiency and cost-savings promises of software-defined networking.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>According to Goldman Sachs managing director and technology fellow Matthew Liste, quoted in NetworkWorld, â€œWe really desire commodity scale architectures, software-defined everything.â€ Liste added, â€œWeâ€˜re big believers in open standards and open architecturesâ€¦so we have a say in how things evolve.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As Savage noted, the firm has tried a variety of approaches, including both commercial and open source systems for network overlays.

This is absolutely a marathon.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Google. Google Distinguished Engineer Amin Vahdat described its SDN deployment at the same conference. As Brent Salisbury wrote in Network Computing at the time, â€œVahdat noted that the growth of Google<r>s back-end (east-west) network is quickly surpassing its front-end user-facing network. This growth is expensive because the network doesn<r>t scale economically like storage and compute do. The operating expense of compute and storage becomes cheaper per unit as scale increases, but this is not the case with the network.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Thatâ€™s why Google has separated hardware and software for the network. It no longer has to rely on hardware specs, and can innovate solely in software. It also gets â€œlogically centralized control that will be more deterministic, more efficient and more fault-tolerant,â€ along with more automation. The upshot: faster innovation, and whoâ€™s not searching for that? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Kanazawa University Hospital. This hospital in Kanazawa, Japan, has deployed SDN to become more responsive to the rapidly evolving healthcare industry. As one of its executives explained, â€œA network that requires setting changes and rewiring every time a new piece of equipment is connected cannot be called stable. We needed a flexible, safe, and secure network infrastructure that would allow us to respond immediately to the rapid changes that occur in our field, provide independent security for each department, and be easy to manage.â€ Hear, hear. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As Nuage Networks CEO Sunil Khandekar noted in this video interview with Light Readingâ€™s Ray Le Maistre, his company has 15 deployments in 18 months.

Being an independent developer means you have to think beyond coding, about all partnerships and business prospective too. A single mistake may mean a lot for an independent developer. Here we<r>ll discuss 10 best practices which an independent developer should always follow. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. Coding with business: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Coding with quality is very important for independent developers but business is equally important. You should have an eye for detail while coding. Devote yourself to coding and at the time of coding don<r>t think about marketing, administration and other sections. So don<r>t forget business while coding. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Brand loyalty: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>You should always maintain your brand, quality and consistency. Present your work and your development through your own brand. Don<r>t be inconsistent so that your business never suffers. Building an attractive brand is very important for an independent developer. Stand for your work and your brand. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Maintain individuality: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Being an independent developer you should think about customer satisfaction. But don<r>t try to please everybody and maintain your individuality. Pay attention to your limits and don<r>t commit more than you can perform. Run your business with your individuality. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Spot your target market: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As you are running a small business, you always should find out ideal clients and the right market. Finding out and targeting the right market is an art. Be fearless always and show your organisational courage in the market. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. Pay due attention to your project champion: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Your software project must have a champion who will defend your project in every possible way so that it succeeds. Identify this person and create a valuable relationship with him/her to ensure that he/she perform the checks daily. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. Maintain a proper sales team: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>You should have a proper sales team who can sell the software in a customised way. You should know your target audience and know the custom solution too so that the direction and foundation of your business changes according to market requirements. Add prospects to your sales pipeline. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7.

Then imagine that your phone tells you that you have only a 66 percent chance of meeting those criteriaâ€”but that if you can wait until 1:00 for lunch, or if you<r>re willing to eat at TGI Friday<r>s instead, it can get that probability up to 99 percent. <s><br/> <s>That kind of application is the goal of Brian Williams<r> group at MIT<r>s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratoryâ€”although the same underlying framework has led to software that both NASA and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have used to plan missions. <br/> <s>At the annual meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) this month, researchers in Williams<r> group will present algorithms that represent significant steps toward what Williams describes as <a>quot;a better Siri<a>quot;â€”the user-assistance application found in Apple products. But they would be just as useful for any planning taskâ€”say, scheduling flights or bus routes. <br/> <s>Together with Williams, Peng Yu and Cheng Fang, who are graduate students in MIT<r>s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, have developed software that allows a planner to specify constraintsâ€”say, buses along a certain route should reach their destination at 10-minute intervalsâ€”and reliability thresholds, such as that the buses should be on time at least 90 percent of the time. Then, on the basis of probabilistic modelsâ€”which reveal data such as that travel time along this mile of road fluctuates between two and 10 minutesâ€”the system determines whether a solution exists: For example, perhaps the buses<r> departures should be staggered by six minutes at some times of day, 12 minutes at others. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>If, however, a solution doesn<r>t exist, the software doesn<r>t give up. Instead, it suggests ways in which the planner might relax the problem constraints: Could the buses reach their destinations at 12-minute intervals? If the planner rejects the proposed amendment, the software offers an alternative: Could you add a bus to the route? <br/> <s>Short tails <br/> <s> <br/> <s>One aspect of the software that distinguishes it from previous planning systems is that it assesses risk. <a>quot;It<r>s always hard working directly with probabilities, because they always add complexity to your computations,<a>quot; Fang says. <a>quot;So we added this idea of risk allocation. We say, <r>What<r>s your budget of risk for this entire mission? Let<r>s divide that up and use it as a resource.<r><a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The time it takes to traverse any mile of a bus route, for instance, can be represented by a probability distributionâ€”a bell curve, plotting time against probability. Keeping track of all those probabilities and compounding them for every mile of the route would yield a huge computation. But if the system knows in advance that the planner can tolerate a certain amount of failure, it can, in effect, assign that failure to the lowest-probability outcomes in the distributions, lopping off their tails. That makes them much easier to deal with mathematically. <br/> <s>At AAAI, Williams and another of his students, Andrew Wang, have a paper describing how to evaluate those assignments efficiently, in order to find quick solutions to soluble planning problems. But the paper with Yu and Fangâ€”which appears at the same conference sessionâ€”concentrates on identifying those constraints that prevent a problem<r>s solution. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>There<r>s the rub: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Both procedures are rooted in graph theory. In this context, a graph is a data representation that consists of nodes, usually depicted as circles, and edges, usually depicted as line segments connecting the nodes. Any scheduling problem can be represented as a graph. Nodes represent events, and the edges indicate the sequence in which events must occur. Each edge also has an associated weight, indicating the cost of progressing from one event to the nextâ€”the time it takes a bus to travel between stops, for instance. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Yu, Williams, and Fang<r>s algorithm first represents a problem as a graph, then begins adding edges that represent the constraints imposed by the planner. If the problem is soluble, the weights of the edges representing constraints will everywhere be greater than the weights representing the costs of transitions between events. Existing algorithms, however, can quickly home in on loops in the graph where the weights are imbalanced. The MIT researchers<r> system then calculates the lowest-cost way of rebalancing the loop, which it presents to the planner as a modification of the problem<r>s initial constraints. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;These papers are quite interesting,<a>quot; says Jiaying Shen, a research scientist at Nuance Communications, which developed the voice-recognition technology used by Apple<r>s Siri. <a>quot;They had a flurry of papers on chance constraints, but in the recent papers, they added uncertainty in there, which makes the problems that it can model more complicated and unpredictable and more realistic.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>At Nuance, <a>quot;We are very interested in constraint relaxation, including the chance constraints,<a>quot; Shen adds. <a>quot;If you expose what you need to consider in the planning stage, then you have a much higher success rate in carrying out the plan.<a>quot; <br/> <s>http://phys.org/news/2015-01-algorithms-probability-success-low-risk-alternatives.html'),

We discuss the characteristics of various types of acellular aAPCs, and their clinical potential in cancer immunotherapy.

By targeting tumor cells or their microenvironment, passive immunotherapy exploiting monoclonal antibodies has proven beneficial clinical effects in several malignancies. In active immunotherapy, immune cells are stimulated and instructed to actively fight cancer and although more challenging, this approach is extremely promising. Active immunotherapy is highly dependent on efficient stimulation of antigen-specific immune cells, such as killer T cells and antibody-producing B cells.

Engineered T cells have been clinically applied and show good results, but several issues need to be addressed, including on-target and off-target toxicities, undesirable immune responses to chimeric antigen receptors and engineered TCRs, and the possibility of transformation, either because of virus-related insertional mutagenesis or misguided T cell lifetime engineering.

However, the limited availability of autologous tumor-cell membranes to cover the silica beads restricts the wide applicability of this approach. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In another strategy, microsized polystyrene beads coated with tumor antigen-specific peptideâ€“MHC complexes, anti-CD28 and anti-4-1BB, were injected into tumor-bearing mice. These beads efficiently decreased tumor size and delayed tumor progression. Similar results were obtained for magnetic polystyrene microbeads in a mouse tumor model . Interestingly, when compared to spherical PLGA microparticles, ellipsoid particles were most efficient in reducing tumor size and extending survival times in melanoma-bearing mice, again emphasizing the importance of size and shape . Incorporation of IL-2 into biodegradable particles also improved their efficacy and reduced tumor growth kinetics in mice engrafted with B16 tumors . IL-2 encapsulation can also be combined in SLB particles with small-molecule inhibitors, such as TGF-Î² inhibitors, which increased the activity of intratumoral T cells in vivo . <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Although no in vivo toxicities were observed, several of the aAPCs used so far are non-deformable, large, and in some cases non-biodegradable, which may lead to embolisms, making clinical approval for in vivo use difficult . <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Thus, in contrast to microbeads, nanosized particles might be safer and have a better chance of obtaining clinical approval. Particle sizes below 100 nm enable easy entry into the lymphatic system and allow for transportation to the lymph nodes, where particles can gain access to larger numbers of T cells . For example, MHC class II-containing RAFTsomes, which are flexible nanoparticles, were able to induce CD4  T cell responses that prevented EG.7 tumor inoculation and reduced tumor sizes in mice . Unfortunately, generation of these nanoparticles requires DC-derived lipid rafts, and therefore does not completely eliminate the need for isolation and culture of autologous APCs. Alternatively, completely synthetic nanosized aAPCs have been tested for their in vivo potential in cancer immunotherapy. Both dextran-coated iron oxide magnetic particles (50â€“100 nm) and dextran-coated quantum dots (30 nm) can effectively stimulate tumor antigen-specific T cells and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. They are also more efficiently distributed and better capable of reaching T cell pools in mice than micro-aAPCs . <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> Scource : http;//www.sciencedirect.com '),

It is designed to defend you against millions of bacteria, microbes, viruses, toxins and parasites that would love to invade your body. To understand the power of the immune system, all that you have to do is look at what happens to anything once it dies. That sounds gross, but it does show you something very important about your immune system. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>When something dies, its immune system (along with everything else) shuts down. In a matter of hours, the body is invaded by all sorts of bacteria, microbes, parasites... None of these things are able to get in when your immune system is working, but the moment your immune system stops the door is wide open. Once you die it only takes a few weeks for these organisms to completely dismantle your body and carry it away, until all that<r>s left is a skeleton. Obviously your immune system is doing something amazing to keep all of that dismantling from happening when you are alive. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The immune system is complex, intricate and interesting. And there are at least two good reasons for you to know more about it. First, it is just plain fascinating to understand where things like fevers, hives, inflammation, etc., come from when they happen inside your own body. You also hear a lot about the immune system in the news as new parts of it are understood and new drugs come on the market -- knowing about the immune system makes these news stories understandable. In this article, we will take a look at how your immune system works so that you can understand what it is doing for you each day, as well as what it is not. <br/> <s>'),

And it turns out that <a>quot;white blood cells<a>quot; are actually a whole collection of different cells that work together to destroy bacteria and viruses. Here are all of the different types, names and classifications of white blood cells working inside your body right now: <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>Leukocytes <br/> <s> <s> <s>Lymphocyte <br/> <s> <s> <s>Monocytes <br/> <s> <s> <s>Granulocytes <br/> <s> <s> <s>B-cells <br/> <s> <s> <s>Plasma cells <br/> <s> <s> <s>T-cells <br/> <s> <s> <s>Helper T-cells <br/> <s> <s> <s>Killer T-cells <br/> <s> <s> <s>Suppressor T-cells <br/> <s> <s> <s>Natural killer cells <br/> <s> <s> <s>Neutrophils <br/> <s> <s> <s>Eosinophils <br/> <s> <s> <s>Basophils <br/> <s> <s> <s>Phagocytes <br/> <s> <s> <s>Macrophages <br/> <s>All white blood cells are known officially as leukocytes. White blood cells are not like normal cells in the body -- they actually act like independent, living single-cell organisms able to move and capture things on their own. White blood cells behave very much like amoeba in their movements and are able to engulf other cells and bacteria. Many white blood cells cannot divide and reproduce on their own, but instead have a factory somewhere in the body that produces them. That factory is the bone marrow. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Leukocytes are divided into three classes: <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>Granulocytes - Granulocytes make up 50% to 60% of all leukocytes. Granulocytes are themselves divided into three classes: neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Granulocytes get their name because they contain granules, and these granules contain different chemicals depending on the type of cell. <br/> <s> <s> <s>Lymphocyte - Lymphocytes make up 30% to 40% of all leukocytes. Lymphocytes come in two classes: B cells (those that mature in bone marrow) and T cells (those that mature in the thymus). <br/> <s> <s> <s>Monocyte - Monocytes make up 7% or so of all leukocytes. Monocytes evolve into macrophages. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>All white blood cells start in bone marrow as stem cells. Stem cells are generic cells that can form into the many different types of leukocytes as they mature. For example, you can take a mouse, irradiate it to kill off its bone marrow<r>s ability to produce new blood cells, and then inject stem cells into the mouse<r>s blood stream. The stem cells will divide and differentiate into all different types of white blood cells. A <a>quot;bone marrow transplant<a>quot; is accomplished simply by injecting stem cells from a donor into the blood stream. The stem cells find their way, almost magically, into the marrow and make their home there. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s>Neutrophils are by far the most common form of white blood cells that you have in your body. Your bone marrow produces trillions of them every day and releases them into the bloodstream, but their life span is short -- generally less than a day. Once in the bloodstream neutrophils can move through capillary walls into tissue. Neutorphils are attracted to foreign material, inflammation and bacteria. If you get a splinter or a cut, neutrophils will be attracted by a process called chemotaxis. Many single-celled organisms use this same process -- chemotaxis lets motile cells move toward higher concentrations of a chemical. Once a neutrophil finds a foreign particle or a bacteria it will engulf it, releasing enzymes, hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals from its granules to kill the bacteria. In a site of serious infection (where lots of bacteria have reproduced in the area), pus will form. Pus is simply dead neutrophils and other cellular debris. <br/> <s> <s> <s>Eosinophils and basophils are far less common than neutrophils. Eosinophils seem focused on parasites in the skin and the lungs, while Basophils carry histamine and therefore important (along with mast cells) to causing inflammation. From the immune system<r>s standpoint inflammation is a good thing. It brings in more blood and it dilates capillary walls so that more immune system cells can get to the site of infection. <br/> <s> <s> <s>Of all blood cells, macrophages are the biggest (hence the name <a>quot;macro<a>quot;). Monocytes are released by the bone marrow, float in the bloodstream, enter tissue and turn into macrophages. Most boundary tissue has its own devoted macrophages. For example, alveolar macrophages live in the lungs and keep the lungs clean (by ingesting foreign particles like smoke and dust) and disease free (by ingesting bacteria and microbes). Macrophages are called langerhans cells when they live in the skin. Macrophages also swim freely. One of their jobs is to clean up dead neutrophils -- macropghages clean up pus, for example, as part of the healing process. <br/> <s> <s> <s>The lymphocytes handle most of the bacterial and viral infections that we get. Lymphocytes start in the bone marrow. Those destined to become B cells develop in the marrow before entering the bloodstream. T cells start in the marrow but migrate through the bloodstream to the thymus and mature there. T cells and B cells are often found in the bloodstream but tend to concentrate in lymph tissue such as the lymph nodes, the thymus and the spleen. There is also quite a bit of lymph tissue in the digestive system. B cells and T cells have different functions. <br/> <s> <s> <s>B cells, when stimulated, mature into plasma cells -- these are the cells that produce antibodies. A specific B cell is tuned to a specific germ, and when the germ is present in the body the B cell clones itself and produces millions of antibodies designed to eliminate the germ. <br/> <s> <s> <s>T cells, on the other hand, actually bump up against cells and kill them. T cells known as Killer T cells can detect cells in your body that are harboring viruses, and when it detects such a cell it kills it. Two other types of T cells, known as Helper and Suppressor T cells, help sensitize killer T cells and control the immune response.'),

However, these actually represent a hyper-response to external allergens, according to Dr. Matthew Lau, chief, department of allergy and immunology at Kaiser Permanente Hawaii. Asthma and allergies also involve the immune system. A normally harmless material, such as grass pollen, food particles, mold or pet dander, is mistaken for a severe threat and attacked. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Other dysregulation of the immune system includes autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. <a>quot;Finally, some less common disease related to deficient immune system conditions are antibody deficiencies and cell mediated conditions that may show up congenitally,<a>quot; Lau told Live Science. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer, according to the NIH. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is not as strong as normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center. <s>In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or through the use of immunosuppressive medication. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>On the opposite end of the spectrum, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign bodies, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto<r>s thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1 and systemic lupus erythematosus. Another disease considered to be an autoimmune disorder is myasthenia gravis (pronounced my-us-THEE-nee-uh GRAY-vis). <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In overactive or autoimmune conditions, medications that reduce the immune response, such as corticosteroids or other immune suppressive agents, can be very helpful. <a>quot;In some immune deficiency conditions, the treatment may be replacement of missing or deficiency elements,<a>quot; Lau said. <a>quot;This may be infusions of antibodies to fight infections.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Treatment may also include monoclonal antibodies, Lau said. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein made in a lab that can bind to substances in the body. They can be used to regulate parts of the immune response that are causing inflammation, Lau said. According to the National Cancer Institute, monoclonal antibodies are being used to treat cancer. They can carry drugs, toxins or radioactive substances directly to cancer cells.');

HTML5   JavaScript = VNC Client. <br/> <s> II. by using Web sockets. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>What is Web socket? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Web Socket is a web technology providing full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection. The Web Socket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the Web Socket API for the WebIDL language is being standardized by the W3C. <br/> <s>Web Socket is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. The Web Socket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade request. The Web Socket protocol makes possible more interaction between a browser and a web site, facilitating live content and the creation of real-time games. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the browser without being solicited by the client, and allowing for messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way a two-way (bi-directional) ongoing conversation can take place between a browser and the server. A similar effect has been achieved in non-standardized ways using stop-gap technologies such as Comet. <br/> <s>In addition, the communications are done over TCP port number 80, which is of benefit for those environments which block non-standard Internet connections using a firewall. WebSocket protocol is currently supported in several browsers including Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera. Web Socket also requires web applications on the server to support it. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <br/> <s>References: <br/> <s> 1. http://www.seminarsonly.com/electronics/Remote-Access-Service.php <br/> <s> 2. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383015(v=vs.85).aspx <br/> <s> 3.

However, traditional methods in molecular biology generally work on a <a>quot;one gene in one experiment<a>quot; basis, which means that the throughput is very limited and the <a>quot;whole picture<a>quot; of gene function is hard to obtain. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In the past few years, as a result of the Human Genome Project, there has been an explosion in the amount of information available about the DNA sequence of the human genome. Consequently, researchers have identified a large number of novel genes within these previously unknown sequences. The challenge currently facing scientists is to find a way to organize and catalog this vast amount of information into a usable form. Only after the functions of the new genes are discovered will the full impact of the Human Genome Project be realized, so that researchers can have a better picture of the interactions among thousands of genes simultaneously. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The microarrays theory relies on the following theory - every cell of the body contains a full set of chromosomes and identical genes (with only few exceptional cells). Only a fraction of these genes are turned on, however, and it is the subset that is <a>quot;expressed<a>quot; that confers unique properties to each cell type. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;Gene expression<a>quot; is the term used to describe the transcription of the information contained within the DNA, the repository of genetic information, into messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are then translated into the proteins that perform most of the critical functions of cells. Scientists study the kinds and amounts of mRNA produced by a cell to learn which genes are expressed, which in turn provides insights into how the cell responds to its changing needs. Gene expression is a highly complex and tightly regulated process that allows a cell to respond dynamically both to environmental stimuli and to its own changing needs. This mechanism acts as both an <a>quot;on/off<a>quot; switch to control which genes are expressed in a cell as well as a <a>quot;volume control<a>quot; that increases or decreases the level of expression of particular genes as necessary. <br/> <s>DNA Microarrays are small, solid supports onto which the sequences from thousands of different genes are immobilized, or attached, at fixed locations. The supports themselves are usually glass microscope slides, the size of two side-by-side pinky fingers, but can also be silicon chips or nylon membranes. The DNA is printed, spotted, or actually synthesized directly onto the support. With the aid of a computer, the amount of mRNA bound to the spots on the microarray is precisely measured, generating a profile of gene expression in the cell. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> It is important to understand that microarrays are a significant advance both because they may contain a very large number of genes and because of their small size. Microarrays are therefore useful when one wants to survey a large number of genes quickly or when the sample to be studied is small. Microarrays may be used to assay gene expression within a single sample or to compare gene expression in two different cell types or tissue samples, such as in healthy and diseased tissue. Because a microarray can be used to examine the expression of hundreds or thousands of genes at once, it promises to revolutionize the way scientists examine gene expression. General studies of the expression levels in various kinds of cells represent an important and necessary first step in our understanding and cataloging of the human genome. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As more information accumulates, scientists will be able to use microarrays to ask increasingly complex questions and perform more intricate experiments. With new advances, researchers will be able to infer probable functions of new genes based on similarities in expression patterns with those of known genes. Ultimately, these studies promise to expand the size of existing gene families, reveal new patterns of coordinated gene expression across gene families, and uncover entirely new categories of genes. Furthermore, because the product of any one gene usually interacts with those of many others, our understanding of how these genes coordinate will become clearer through such analyses, and precise knowledge of these inter-relationships will emerge. The use of microarrays may also speed the identification of genes involved in the development of various diseases by enabling scientists to examine a much larger number of genes. This technology will also aid the examination of the integration of gene expression and function at the cellular level, revealing how multiple gene products work together to produce physical and chemical responses to both static and changing cellular needs. The microarray (DNA chip) technology is having a significant impact on genomics study. Drug discovery and toxicological research, will certainly benefit from the use of DNA microarray technology. <br/> <s>The American Heritage Dictionary defines <a>quot;array<a>quot; as <a>quot;to place in an orderly arrangement<a>quot;. It is important that the gene sequences in a microarray are attached to their support in an orderly or fixed way, because a researcher uses the location of each spot in the array to identify a particular gene sequence. The spots themselves can be DNA, cDNA, or oligonucleotides. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>There are two major application forms for the DNA microarray technology: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1) Identification of sequence (gene / gene mutation) <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2) Determination of expression level (abundance) of genes of one sample or comparing gene transcription in two or more different kinds of cells. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In our work we will refer to the second application - determining gene expression level. <br/> <s>probe cDNA (500~5,000 bases long) is immobilized to a solid surface such as glass using robot spotting and exposed to a set of targets either separately or in a mixture. This method, <a>quot;traditionally<a>quot; called DNA microarray, is widely considered as developed at Stanford University. An article by R. Ekins and F.W. Chu (Microarrays: their origins and applications. Trends in Biotechnology, 1999, 17, 217-218) seems to provide some generally forgotten facts. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>After preparing the chip surface and incubating it with the wanted samples we can see different color dots. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The red dots imply expression of a specific gene in sample no 1.

(140, '<img src="uploads/anil/articlePic/2015-01-25_12:03:37pm_dna_png.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;" onError="this.src="img/default.gif"" /><br/> DNA fingerprinting or DNA profiling, any of several similar techniques for analyzing and comparing DNA from separate sources, used especially in law enforcement to identify suspects from hair, blood, semen, or other biological materials found at the scene of a violent crime. It depends on the fact that no two people, save identical twins, have exactly the same DNA sequence, and that although only limited segments of a person<r>s DNA are scrutinized in the procedure, those segments will be statistically unique. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>A common procedure for DNA fingerprinting is restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). In this method, DNA is extracted from a sample and cut into segments using special restriction enzymes. RFLP focuses on segments that contain sequences of repeated DNA bases, which vary widely from person to person. The segments are separated using a laboratory technique called electrophoresis, which sorts the fragments by length. The segments are radioactively tagged to produce a visual pattern known as an autoradiograph, or <a>quot;DNA fingerprint,<a>quot; on X-ray film. A newer method known as short tandem repeats (STR) analyzes DNA segments for the number of repeats at 13 specific DNA sites. The chance of misidentification in this procedure is one in several billion. Yet another process, polymerase chain reaction, is used to produce multiple copies of segments from a very limited amount of DNA (as little as 50 molecules), enabling a DNA fingerprint to be made from a single hair. Once a sufficient sample has been produced, the pattern of the alleles (see genetics) from a limited number of genes is compared with the pattern from the reference sample. A nonmatch is conclusive, but the technique provides less certainty when a match occurs. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In criminal investigations, the DNA fingerprint of a suspect<r>s blood or other body material is compared to that of the evidence from the crime scene to see how closely they match. The technique can also be used to establish paternity. First developed in the mid-1980s, DNA fingerprinting has been accepted in most courts in the United States, and has in several notable instances been used to exonerate or free persons convicted of crimes, but the Supreme Court has ruled (2009) that convicted criminals do not have a constitutional right to DNA testing. All states have established DNA fingerprint databases and require the collection of DNA from convicted felons, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has instituted a national DNA fingerprint database linking those of the states and including DNA collected in connection with federal offenses. DNA fingerprinting is generally regarded as a reliable forensic tool when properly done, but some scientists have called for wider sampling of human DNA to insure that the segments analyzed are indeed highly variable for all ethnic and racial groups. It is possible to create false genetic samples and use them to misdirect forensic investigators, but if those samples have been produced using gene amplification techniques they can be distinguished from normal DNA evidence. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The techniques used in DNA fingerprinting also have applications in paleontology, archaeology, various fields of biology, and medical diagnostics. It has, for example, been used to match the goatskin fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In biological classification, it can help to show evolutionary change and relationships on the molecular level, and it has the advantage of being able to be used even when only very small samples, such as tiny pieces of preserved tissue from extinct animals, are available.'),

A GMO is a plant or animal that has been genetically modified through the addition of a small amount of genetic material from other organisms through molecular techniques. Currently, the GMOs on the market today have been given genetic traits to provide protection from pests, tolerance to pesticides, or improve its quality. Examples of GMO field crops include Bt-potatoes, Bt-corn, Bt-sweet corn, Roundup Ready soybeans, Roundup Ready Corn, and Liberty Link corn. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Genetically modified foods are foods derived from GMO crops. For example, corn produced through biotechnology is being used in many familiar foods, including corn meal and tortilla chips. In addition, corn is used to make high fructose corn syrup, which is used as a sweetener in many foods such as soft drinks and baked goods. While the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) regulates genetically modified foods, it considers Bt-corn to be nutritionally equivalent to traditional corn. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>To transform a plant into a GMO plant, the gene that produces a genetic trait of interest is identified and separated from the rest of the genetic material from a donor organism. Most organisms have thousands of genes, a single gene represents only a tiny fraction of the total genetic makeup of an organism. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>A donor organism may be a bacterium, fungus or even another plant. In the case of Bt corn, the donor organism is a naturally occurring soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, and the gene of interest produces a protein that kills Lepidoptera larvae, in particular, European corn borer. This protein is called the Bt delta endotoxin. Growers use Bt corn as an alternative to spraying insecticides for control of European and southwestern corn borer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s><br/> <s>Bt Delta Endotoxin <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The Bt delta endotoxin was selected because it is highly effective at controlling Lepidoptera larvae, caterpillars. It is during the larval stage when most of the damage by European corn borer occurs. The protein is very selective, generally not harming insects in other orders (such as beetles, flies, bees and wasps). For this reason, GMOs that have the Bt gene are compatible with biological control programs because they harm insect predators and parasitoids much less than broad-spectrum insecticides. The Bt endotoxin is considered safe for humans, other mammals, fish, birds, and the environment because of its selectivity. Bt has been available as a commercial microbial insecticide since the 1960s and is sold under many trade names. These products have an excellent safety record and can be used on many crops until the day of harvest. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>To kill a susceptible insect, a part of the plant that contains the Bt protein (not all parts of the plant necessarily contain the protein in equal concentrations) must be ingested. Within minutes, the protein binds to the gut wall and the insect stops feeding. Within hours, the gut wall breaks down and normal gut bacteria invade the body cavity. The insect dies of septicaemia as bacteria multiply in the blood. Even among Lepidoptera larvae, species differ in sensitivity to the Bt protein. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Genetic Modification <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Do Bt-corn hybrids differ only in that they possess the genetic code to produce the Bt protein? Not exactly. To add a trait to a crop plant, the gene must be inserted along with some additional genetic material. This additional genetic material includes a promoter sequence that, in part, determines how the new trait is expressed in the plant. For example, the promoter may cause to protein to be expressed in certain parts of the plants or only during a particular period of time. There is a marker gene that allows plant breeders to easily determine which plants have been transformed. Herbicide and antibiotic tolerance promoters are commonly used to identify transformed plants. There may also be a plasmid or vector sequence that allows for rapid multiplication of the gene of interest in a bacterial host prior to insertion in the crop plant. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Resistance to glyphosate or glufosinate herbicides.

These highly specialized nerve cells are responsible for communicating information in both chemical and electrical forms. There are also several different types of neurons responsible for different tasks in the human body. Sensory neurons carry information from the sensory receptor cells throughout the body to the brain. Motor neurons transmit information from the brain to the muscles of the body. Interneurons are responsible for communicating information between different neurons in the body. Unlike other body cells, neurons stop reproducing shortly after birth. Because of this, some parts of the brain have more neurons at birth than later in life because neurons die but are not replaced. While neurons do not reproduce, research has shown that new connections between neurons form throughout life. The axon and dendrites are specialized structures designed to transmit and receive information. The connections between cells are known as a synapses. Neurons release chemicals known as neurotransmitters into these synapses to communicate with other neurons. There are three basic parts of a neuron: the dendrites, the cell body and the axon. The dendrites of neurons receive information from sensory receptors or other neurons. This information is then passed down to the cell body and on to the axon. Once the information as arrived at the axon, it travels down the length of the axon in the form of an electrical signal known as an action potential. Once an electrical impulse has reached the end of an axon, the information must be transmitted across the synaptic gap to the dendrites of the adjoining neuron. In some cases, the electrical signal can almost instantaneously bridge the gap between the neurons and continue along its path. n other cases, neurotransmitters are needed to send the information from one neuron to the next. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that are released from the axon terminals to cross the synaptic gap and reach the receptor sites of other neurons. In a process known as reuptake, these neurotransmitters attach to the receptor site and are reabsorbed by the neuron to be reused.'),

Accordingly putting the codes at severs and client end. The communication in between the server and client can take place through the sockets. Client codes should be converted into the JavaScript and HTML by using the services like Java2javascript or Goggle web tool kit. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Detail Architecture of Smart Software Separater: <br/> <s>Here we can see that how that working of Smart Software Saparater will going to work. Various component involve inside the Smart Software coverter. Some of the components are currently existing and some of them are needed to be developed such are component like code converter are currently existen component like Java2Javascript[cite] is currently existen . Java2Javascript is a product of Oracle . Java2Javascript takes java code and convert it into javascript codes.

Communication between the server and client can take place by the sockets . Socketise should be developed that can put the socket in order to communicate are relative place.

These are basic interface which are provided for some jave utility. Whereever the user interface separater find that the methods are interacting with none interfacing object. It will put a mark there. The marking done by the Interface separater will be read by the socketiser in order to put there socket and let the interface and other codes communicate over the network. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Software Class Profiling: Here in this method the software will profile various method of the class and find the running time complexty of 2nd or 3rd level of class in class model.

The muscular system, in vertebrates, is controlled through the nervous system, although some muscles, like cardiac muscle, can be completely autonomous. Muscle is contractile tissue and is derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells. Without the skeletal muscular system, the bones would be unable to move. Our bodies are equipped with some 600 skeletal muscles to not only put 206 bones into motion, but also to generate as much as 85% of our body heat, maintain our posture, control the openings involved with the entrance and exit of materials, and to express our emotions and thoughts through movements of our facial muscles. Three important structural terms of skeletal muscular system are a muscleâ€™s origin, insertion, and belly. Most muscles are attached to different bones at each end. This assures that each muscle or its tendon will span at least one joint. When a muscle contracts, it causes movement where one bone remains relatively stationary and the other bone will move. The end of the muscle attached to the relatively stationary bone is called the origin, while the end of the muscle attached to the moving bone is called the insertion. Many muscles are narrow at each end, their origin and insertion, and thick in the middle. This thicker middle region is called the belly. <s> Much of muscle contraction occurs without conscious thought and is necessary for survival, like the contraction of the heart or peristalsis, which pushes food through the digestive system. Voluntary muscle contraction is used to move the body and can be finely controlled, such as movements of the finger or gross movements that of the biceps and triceps.'),

They are: <br/> <s> â€¢ Cardiac muscle <br/> <s> â€¢ Smooth muscle <br/> <s> â€¢ Skeletal muscle <br/> <s> <br/> Cardiac Muscle <br/> <s>The walls of the heart are made of cardiac muscles . When these muscles contract and relax, they circulate blood throughout the body. Cardiac muscles are involuntary. This means they are not controlled consciously like skeletal muscles. Continuous contraction and relaxation of cardiac muscle is necessary for survival. Cardiac muscle does not get tired. It makes the energy it needs to keep the heart beating from birth until death. Another name for cardiac muscle is myocardium. The cardiac cells is the most physically energetic cell in the body, contracting constantly, without tiring, 3 billion times or more in an average human lifespan. By coordinating its beating activity with that of its 3 billion neighbours in the main pump of the human heart, over 7,000 litres of blood are pumped per day, without conscious effort, along 100,000 miles of blood vessels. Coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle cells in the heart propel blood out of the atria and ventricles to the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary circulatory systems. This phenomona is understood as systole of the heart. Cardiac muscle cells, like all tissues in the body, rely on an ample blood supply to deliver oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste products such as carbon dioxide. The coronary arteries fulfill this function. Cardiac muscle is adapted to be highly resistant to fatigue : it has a large number of mitochondria, enabling continuous aerobic respiration via oxidative phosphorylation, numerous myoglobins ( oxygen-storing pigment ) and a good blood supply, which provides nutrients and oxygen. The heart is so tuned to aerobic metabolism that it is unable to pump sufficiently in ischaemic conditions. At basal metabolic rates, about 1% of energy is derived from anaerobic metabolism. This can increase to 10% under moderately hypoxic conditions, but, under more severe hypoxic conditions, not enough energy can be liberated by lactate production to sustain ventricular contractions. In cardiac muscle the cells are in electrical contact through communicating gap junctions. These are important for the orderly spread of excitation through the heart. This starts with the spontaneous depolarisation of the specialised pacemaker cells in the sino-atrial node, spreads via the atria to the atrio-ventricular node and then to the conducting fibres in the Bundle of His (in the intraventricular septum) and the Purkinje system. These cells finally activate the bulk of the ventricular muscle in the chamber walls, in each case through direct electrical contacts. The major causes of cardiovascular disease are tobacco use, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. Tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. High blood pressure has no symptoms, but can cause a sudden stroke or heart attack. Diabetes increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Being overweight increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Low socioeconomic status increases the chances of exposure to risk factors and increases the vulnerability to develop CVD. '),

Its structure differs greatly from that of skeletal muscle, although it can develop isometric force per cross-sectional area that is equal to that of skeletal muscle. However, the speed of smooth muscle contraction is only a small fraction of that of skeletal muscle. The structure of the smooth muscle tissue is quite different from that of other muscle tissue subtypes. The primary smooth muscle structural and functional unit â€“ the smooth muscle myocyte (Myocytus nonstriatus) has unique structure, arrangement and innervation. The spindle shape of the mononucleated smooth muscle cell permits a close contact among cells in the splanchnic and vascular walls. Regardless of its location in the body, the communication between tightly packed adjacent spindle-shaped mononucleated smooth muscle cells occurs via a specific junction, referred to as Macula communicans (nexus, gap junction). The space between the different macular connexons is about 2 nm, which allows low-molecular compounds to pass from one cell to another. This type of junction is analogous to the plasmodesma (pl. plasmodesmata), encountered in cells of plants. The basement membrane covering each smooth muscle cell, is absent at gap junction sites. Â  The most striking feature of smooth muscle is the lack of visible cross striations (hence the name smooth). Smooth muscle fibers are much smaller (2-10Î¼ in diameter) than skeletal muscle fibers (10-100 Î¼ ). It is customary to classify smooth muscle as single-unit and multi-unit smooth muscle. The fibers are assembled in different ways. The muscle fibers making up the single-unit muscle are gathered into dense sheets or bands. Though the fibers run roughly parallel, they are densely and irregularly packed together, most often so that the narrower portion of one fiber lies against the wider portion of its neighbor. These fibers have connections, the plasma membranes of two neighboring fibers form gap junctions that act as low resistance pathway for the rapid spread of electrical signals throughout the tissue. The multi-unit smooth muscle fibers have no interconnecting bridges. They are mingled with connective tissue fibers. Each fiber can contract independently and is usually innervated by a single nerve ending. Fibers insulated from each other by covering of collagen and glycoprotein fibrillae. Seldom exhibit spontaneous contraction. Examples: ciliary muscle of eye, iris, piloerector muscles. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â Aggregates (bundles or sheets) of hundreds or thousands of fibers act as a single unit. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â Membranes are adherent to one another at numerous points so that force generated in one fiber can be transmitted to the next. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â Fibers are connected by gap junctions which allow ion flow from one fiber to another such that action potentials and contractions are simultaneous Â  <br/> <s>Â Â Capable of prolonged tonic contraction â€“ the pace of cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle is about 1/10 to 1/300 that of skeletal muscle. However, the fraction of time that cross-bridges remain intact is greatly increased in smooth muscle. Myosin heads probably have greatly reduced ATPase activity, so the ATP hydrolysis that rotates the head is slower. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â Hence, the rate of ATP use is 1/10 to 1/300 that of skeletal muscle. This efficiency is beneficial to long-term tonicity of most viscera. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â The onset and relaxation of smooth muscle contraction is also slow. Contraction begins 50-100 milliseconds after excitation, peaking after about 1 second, then declines for a period of about 2 seconds â€“ giving a total contraction time of around 3 seconds, and in some tissues up to 30 seconds. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â Examples: walls of viscera: gut, bile ducts, ureters, uterus and many blood vessel. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â The interaction between mast cells and vascular smooth muscle cells that are largely involved in vascular wall motility is of special interest for the cardiovascular system function. The presence of mast cells in blood vesselsâ€™ wall and especially in the tunica media (the muscle layer), supposes a participation in smooth muscle cell activity modulation via release of vasoactive mediators. A similar effect could be hypothesized when mast cells are located close to the blood vessels from the microcirculatory bed and to arterioles in particular, as it is recognized that arterial blood pressure is largely influenced by the smooth Â muscle tone in the wall of arterioles.

All of them aim to make the dominant TV technology, LCD, look better. Here<r>s what these terms all mean. <br/> <s>At CES 2015, we got a glimpse of all the upcoming TV technologies that go beyond 4K. Along with that came the inevitable marketing buzzwords we<r>ll be hearing for the next year. Some of these buzzwords are more than that, though. Some represent advancements that can potentially do a lot for picture quality. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Each of the four advancements below can help improve picture quality in LCD TVs, although one, HDR, can work with OLED TVs, too. And as the battle for picture quality supremacy between LCD and OLED heats up, LCD is going to need all the help it can get. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Though we<r>ve discussed a few of them before, here<r>s an overview of what they<r>ll all mean in 2015 and beyond. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>HDR: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>After 4K itself, which seems so 2014 by now, the most common TV tech discussed at the show was HDR, or High Dynamic Range. There<r>s a lot of confusion as to what this actually means, but the short version is a TV capable of a greater contrast ratio than a typical television (hence, greater dynamic range), and soon there<r>ll be at least a few movies in HDR format to watch on it. <br/> <s>There are potentially other aspects, like a wider color gamut, that can also be a part of HDR. Essentially, by using advanced local dimming techniques, a TV can display whites that are significantly brighter than a non-HDR TV<r>s, while keeping the blacks as close to black as possible. Which, at least in the case of OLED, means perfectly black. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Quantum dots: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This is another cool TV technology that sounds more like marketing than science, but it<r>s actually comfortably both. Quantum dots are tiny particles, also called nanocrystals, that glow a certain wavelength of color depending on their size when supplied a bit of energy. <br/> <s>Sony<r>s W900A from 2013 used quantum dots from QD Vision arranged in a tube in front of blue LEDs. The blue LEDs would not only create blue light, but that blue light would energize the red and green quantum dots, to create red and green light. The color on the TV was fantastic. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Bottom line: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>While we all lament the loss of plasma (this was the first year this century it wasn<r>t mentioned anywhere at CES), and the slow rollout of OLED, LCD manufacturers have some interesting tech planned for their 2015 models. Potentially, these could be the best-looking LCDs yet. Possibly, the best-looking displays. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>MEMS: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This isn<r>t really a 2015 development, more of a potential TV tech for the future. IGZO-MEMS, or Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide-Micro Electro Mechanical System, is a joint development between Sharp and Qualcomm subsidiary Pixtronix. <br/> <s>Instead of using a liquid crystal layer to (imperfectly) block the light created by the LED backlight, MEMS uses mechanical shutters (image at top). These slide to block the light and turn a pixel <a>quot;off.<a>quot; Sharp claims this makes for an even more energy-efficient display. Because there<r>s no color filter (color is created sequentially from RGB LEDs), there<r>s the potential of an even wider color gamut. There<r>s also potentially no motion blur. <br/> <s>For more info check at http://www.cnet.com/news/new-tv-tech-for-2015-improving-the-lcd/');

Customer service improves dramatically when employees at every stage of the sales cycle have convenient and immediate access to corporate data anytime, anywhere. However, developing enterprise mobile apps also opens a new set of challenges. To truly unlock the full potential of enterprise mobility, IT needs to develop mobile apps that are attractive and easy to use while providing the functionality users need. <br/> <s>Magic Software held a roundtable with mobility experts from around the world to discuss common characteristics of successful mobile apps. Participants included a senior analyst and mobile blogger, a CEO of an award-winning design agency, a leading usability and user experience consultant along with the senior vice president of Magicâ€™s Americas branch. <br/> <s>Here is a summary of their conclusions. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Leverage device capabilities that add value. Including features that make day-to-day tasks easier is critical for winning over users: <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> Benny Oberlender, vice president at Puzzlehead UX consultancy stated, â€œDevelopers should consider the technical capabilities of the mobile device that can increase business efficiency including maps, GPS, camera, phone calls, scanning and the like. In addition [to] being simple, easy and fun to use, the mobile app should anticipate my needs and add value in new ways I donâ€™t expect.â€ Developers should understand the intent of the user and the context of use. Context sensitivity delivers the full mobile experience with voice, GPS, sensors, cameras and every other capability of the device engaged. Kevin Benedict, mobile blogger and Senior Analyst for Digital Transformation at Cognizant explained, â€œIdeally the application should be aware of my Code Halo (personal data, roles, responsibilities, assigned tasks, etc.). Rather than wait for a request, I want the app to predict my needs based on its understanding of me.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Ensure satisfactory performance. While some participants thought user interface and performance were equally important, others put greater emphasis on performance: <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s><a>quot;The visual design of the app affects the level of trust in the system and raises the degree of pleasure users get from it over time. <s>But in order to prevent user frustration, it is important to have an app that performs well and is responsive, works offline and is always available,â€ explained Benny Oberlender. <s>Responsiveness and offline mode are essential foundations. Without back-end server performance, what good is design? Without an offline mode, what good is your app if users lose their connection? On the other hand, I can have a speedy server and an offline mode, but without an intuitive user experience, I will not have anyone using my app. Idit Mishan, CEO at the award-winning design agency Dogma and Yangrin added, â€œYou either create an app that works well AND looks good, or donâ€™t develop the app at all.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Maintain flexible development options: <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s><br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>The Native v. HTML5 debate isnâ€™t over. <s>While everyone agreed that using native development technologies can result in a more natural and intuitive user experience, HTML5 development and multi-platform app development tools can be more resource efficient. Idit Mishan commented, â€œI canâ€™t say it is mandatory to use native clients; there are companies who innovate and create new usage patterns. But sometimes, itâ€™s a good decision to follow an already-existing structure â€¦ and use native elements for a better user experience and for a better chance of a successful app.â€ Kevin Benedict mentioned the importance of considering development costs, â€œThe amount of value you receive from developing in a native environment v. HTML5 should be considered against the far higher total cost of ownership of developing the same mobile app in a native environment for three different operating systems.â€ It isnâ€™t an either/or scenario. Tools like Magicâ€™s multi-channel application platform make it economical to create and maintain native applications as well as hybrid HTML5 applications. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Plan for integration with back-office systems: <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>This shouldnâ€™t be an afterthought. How an app lets users implement processes is an important part of the user experience. â€œIt is imperative to consider data feeds and queries that are impacted by backend systems and integrations,â€ commented Kevin Benedict. â€œAll of the features have an important influence on performance and contribute to the user experience.â€ User experience includes everything that happens behind the scenes: integration, reliability, security, and authentication. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Deliver a strong ROI: <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s>Time-to-market, updating and maintenance costs need to factor into the ROI calculation. â€œA positive ROI cannot be reached with small numbers of users if too much time and money is spent on design,â€ commented Kevin Benedict. â€œYou should deliver the best mobile app and experience as possible given the numbers of users involved.â€ Mobile apps need to be updated frequently due to the fast pace of change in mobile technology. Organizations that donâ€™t keep up with that are putting their apps in danger of being labelled as out of touch. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Apps that are deemed a success bring value, utilize the device features users are familiar with, and can respond rapidly to dynamic business processes and changes in technology. Successful mobile apps not only deliver ROI based on increased efficiencies, but they also create strong user loyalty and enthusiasm for the value that IT brings. <br/> <s>An article from https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2015/1/5-ux-must-haves-mobile-enterprise-apps'),

Hence, the applications can be categorized into energy store, management and generation for home, building, and industrial, respectively. <br/> <s>Besides the basic functions within a building and home such as lighting and temperature control, energy management system (EMS) is a core application providing the capability for in-home/building display of customer usage, reading of meters, and integration with building management systems and the enterprise, and remote load control, monitoring and control of distributed generation, the EMS provides auditing/logging for system troubleshooting and security purposes as well. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2.Operation Domain <br/> <s>This domain consists of the applications for distributed network operation, including the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems to monitor and control the status of devices in bulk generation, transmission, and distribution domains. <br/> <s>Operation domain also consists of the applications for general operations, including the asset management and meter data management (i.e., energy usage, energy generation, meter logs, and meter test results) to make energy data available to authorized parties. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3.Service Provider <br/> <s>This domain consists of applications such as customer and account management, and installation management. Customer management is to manage customer relationships by providing point-of-contact and resolution for customer issues and problems. Conversely, installation management is to install and maintain the premises equipment that interacts with the Smart Grid. <br/> <s>Service provider domain also consists of applications such as billing/ account management, home management, building management, and others. In particular, building management is to monitor and control building energy, and respond to Smart Grid signals while minimizing impact on building occupants. Home management is to monitor and control home energy and respond to Smart Grid signals while minimizing impact on home occupants. Billing management is to manage customer billing information. Account management is to manage the supplier and customer business accounts. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4.Markets <br/> <s>The main applications include the distributed energy resource aggregation, wholesaler and retailer marketing. To be specific, retailers sell power to end customers and may play aggregation role as a broker between customers and the market. Most of retailers are connected to a trading organization to allow participation in the wholesale market. <br/> <s>Other applications include dynamic pricing, trading, and market management. Traders are participants in markets and include aggregators for provision and consumption and curtailment, and other qualified parties. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5.Bulk Generation <br/> <s>The main applications in this domain include bulk generation plant control, measure, and traditional energy generation. In particular, the plant control permits the operations domain to manage the flow of power and ensures the reliability of the system. Measurement is used to provide visibility into the flow of power and know the condition of the systems in the field remotely. <br/> <s>Other applications include renewable energy generation and storage. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6.Transmission and Distribution <br/> <s>The main applications within these two domains include distributed energy generation (i.e., wind, solar, thermal), distributed storage, substation, and local distribution network monitoring and control. Substation management and control contains switching, protection and control equipment, i.e., sub-stations connecting generation (including peaking units) and storage with distribution. Substations may also connect two or more transmission lines. <br/> <s>Other applications include local network monitoring and control used to measure, record, and control with the intent of protecting and optimizing the operation of electricity transmission and distribution. <br/> <s>'),
(177, ' The communication in smart grids consists of the following two sub-planes or functional groupings. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1.Information Access. It determines the syntax and semantic of application related data. Given each specific domain, we shall define the format of data to meet the application/service requirements. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2.Communication Network. It enables the reliable, efficient and secured transmission of the application/ service specific data. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In the communication network, it is necessary to consider both the network architecture and performance measures to meet the application/service requirements, including the Quality of Service (QoS) and security of information transmission over the network. The detailed description is listed below: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1.For the network architecture, one shall consider different options, covering home area networks, access/neighbourhood area networks, and wide area networks, and the use of Internet-based technologies along with other choices. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2.For the QoS, one shall consider different metrics (i.e., end-to-end latency, bandwidth, jitter, and reliability) along with different types of applications (i.e., the amount of data needs to be transmitted in a given deadline in order to successfully accomplish a task). To be specific, the latency shall be very tight in SCADA system in comparison with the normal meter reading and configuration in Advance Metering Infrastructure (AMI). In the August 14, 2003, blackout, a contributing factor was the issue with communications latency in control systems. With the exception of the initial power equipment problems, the on-going and cascading failures will be primarily due to problems in providing the right information to the right individuals within the right time period. Service differentiation and prioritization may be required depending on the quality and type of applications, which are supported by the communication links. Many standards and protocols mentioned above contain the mechanisms to achieve differentiated QoS services. As an example, the admission control, queuing scheduling algorithms, Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) and others have been extensively studied to provide QoS in IP networks. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> 3.Furthermore, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of network must be addressed as well. Confidentiality is preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. Integrity is the guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity. Each classification displays the level of adverse effect the destruction of information can be expected to have on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information. Availability ensures timely and reliable access to and use of information. Each classification displays the level of adverse effect the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system can be expected to have on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> 4. Power grid information security and protection requirements have aspects of the control network for the operation of energy transmission and distribution (i.e., SCADA), computer networks (i.e., transmitting meter data) as well as enterprise Information Technology (IT) network for business. Although all networks require information security services for dealing with malicious attacks or providing protection against inadvertent errors, specific distinctions in attack and error types, and differences in performance requirements as well as organizational policies for them make their required security posturing quite different in those areas. Hence, we shall systematically analyze the vulnerabilities in Smart Grid, explore the space of attacks targeting different weaknesses of Smart Grid, and develop possible countermeasures against those attacks. <br/> <s>'),

It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Properties typical of embedded computers when compared with general-purpose ones are e.g. low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges and low per-unit cost.

In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to specialised in certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP). <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance.

A study shows that two types of similarities exists between two code fragments. <s>Similarities of two code fragments are based on their similarity of program text and similarity of functionality. <s><br/> <s>First three types are based on textual similarity and type four is based on functional similarity. Â  <s><br/> <s>The complexity of detecting software clones increases with each type i.e., from type 1 to type 4 clones. <br/> <s> <br/> Type 1 (exact clones): <s><br/> <s> <s>Exact clones are similar code fragments but dissimilarity in white space and comments. <s>Type 1 clones are broadly known as exact clones. For example take two code fragments and these both codes are exact copy of each other after removing white spaces and comments. Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Â 			Even if we put something else or more words in comment line and more spaces in one or two code fragments then also these two code fragments are exact clones after removing white spaces and comments.

Type 2 clones are widely known as parameterized clones. <s><br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> A parameterized clone is a code fragment which is same as the original except for some possible variations in the names of corresponding user-defined identifiers. The reserved words and sentence structures are mostly the same as the original one. For example take two code fragments in which a change is made to their variable names and value assignments but the syntactic structure is same in both code fragments. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> <s>Type 3 (near-miss clones): <s><br/> <s> <s>Code fragments with further modifications such as statements insertion/deletion and also changes to identifiers, types, layout, and literals. Some number of statements insertion to and deletion from original source code fragment brings in type 3 clones. Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Â  Type 3 clone are widely known as near-miss clones because the cloned code is nearly matched with original code with some less or more number of statements. In most cases all the statements of original source code used directly after being changed in their identifiers, literals and with some modification of statements like insertion or deletion of statements. <br/> <s>Â  <br/> Type 4 (semantic clones): <s><br/> <s> Code clones are the result of semantic similarity between two or more code fragments. These code clones are functionally similar but differ in textually. Â According to (Roy <a>amp; Cordy, 2007, refer pdf), two code segments may be developed by two different programmers to implement the same kind of logic making the code fragments similar to in their functionality. <br/> <s> <s> <s> <s> <s> Functional similarity reflects the degree to which the components act alike, captures similar functional properties and similar assessment methods rely on matching of pre/post-condition. Â Here we are taking an example of factorial program in which in one source code fragment a simple for loop is executed and functionality is result come as factorial. But in other source code fragment, a recursion method is called and functionality is same as in first code fragment i.e. results in factorial. Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <s><br/> Structural clones: Â  <br/> <s> <s>Structural clones are different from simple clones as these clones are formed by larger program structures formed by configuration of simple clones. Structural clones can provide higher level of similarity situation in a software system than simple clones. Â Structural clones are defined as hierarchically as recurring configuration of entities where corresponding entities are already conceded as clones of each other. Â Structural clones are recognized as two types: file-level structural clones and collaborative structural clones. Â Structural clone class is formed by a group of program structures whose respective elements are similar and inter-related in a similar way. <br/> <s><br/> Function Clones: <s><br/> <s> Function clones are simply clones that are restricted to refer to entire functions or procedures. Function clones are therefore, a subset of structural clones. Function clones can be any of the four types of clones based on it similarity level. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> Model clone: Â  <br/> <s> <s>In new era of software development process, mostly software are developed using design of models. Model clone detection deals with identification of duplicated parts in models. A model clone is a set of similar or identical fragments in a model. A model clone is a pair of model fragments such that there is a high degree of similarity between the fragments. <s>A model fragment is a set of model elements that is closed under the containment relationship. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> Non-contiguous clones: Â  <s><br/> <s> <s>Non-contiguous clones are kind of near-miss clones where gaps are allowed between the code fragments and therefore, non-contiguous clones are basically gapped clones. Â All the editing activities that allowed for gapped clones are also allowed for non-contiguous clones. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â 		 Â  <br/> Reordered clones: <s><br/> <s> <s>A reordering of some segments may be possible in the copied fragment that does not alter the data or control dependencies of the fragment compare to the original. Even though some statements are reordered and variables are renamed, the functionalities of Fragment 1 are the same as the Fragment 2 .

Are you prepared? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The top trends for 2015 include the Computing Everywhere, Internet of Things; 3-D printing; advanced, pervasive, and invisible analytics; context-rich systems; Smart Machines; Cloud/Client Computing; Software-Defined Applications and Infrastructure; Web-Scale IT and risk-based security and self-protection. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Computing Everywhere: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As mobile devices continue to proliferate, Gartner predicts an increased emphasis on serving the needs of the mobile user in diverse contexts and environments, as opposed to focusing on devices alone. <br/> <s><a>quot;Phones and wearable devices are now part of an expanded computing environment that includes such things as consumer electronics and connected screens in the workplace and public space,<a>quot; said Mr. Cearley. <a>quot;Increasingly, it<r>s the overall environment that will need to adapt to the requirements of the mobile user. This will continue to raise significant management challenges for IT organizations as they lose control of user endpoint devices. It will also require increased attention to user experience design.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The Internet of Things: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The combination of data streams and services created by digitizing everything creates four basic usage models â€” Manage, Monetize, Operate and Extend. These four basic models can be applied to any of the four <a>quot;Internets.<a>quot; Enterprises should not limit themselves to thinking that only the Internet of Things (IoT) (assets and machines) has the potential to leverage these four models. For example, the pay-per-use model can be applied to assets (such as industrial equipment), services (such as pay-as-you-drive insurance), people (such as movers), places (such as parking spots) and systems (such as cloud services). Enterprises from all industries can leverage these four models. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3D Printing: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Worldwide shipments of 3D printers are expected to grow 98 percent in 2015, followed by a doubling of unit shipments in 2016. 3D printing will reach a tipping point over the next three years as the market for relatively low-cost 3D printing devices continues to grow rapidly and industrial use expands significantly. New industrial, biomedical and consumer applications will continue to demonstrate that 3D printing is a real, viable and cost-effective means to reduce costs through improved designs, streamlined prototyping and short-run manufacturing. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Advanced, Pervasive and Invisible Analytics: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Analytics will take center stage as the volume of data generated by embedded systems increases and vast pools of structured and unstructured data inside and outside the enterprise are analyzed. <a>quot;Every app now needs to be an analytic app,<a>quot; said Mr. Cearley. <a>quot;Organizations need to manage how best to filter the huge amounts of data coming from the IoT, social media and wearable devices, and then deliver exactly the right information to the right person, at the right time. Analytics will become deeply, but invisibly embedded everywhere.<a>quot; Big data remains an important enabler for this trend but the focus needs to shift to thinking about big questions and big answers first and big data second â€” the value is in the answers, not the data. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Context-Rich Systems: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Ubiquitous embedded intelligence combined with pervasive analytics will drive the development of systems that are alert to their surroundings and able to respond appropriately. Context-aware security is an early application of this new capability, but others will emerge. By understanding the context of a user request, applications can not only adjust their security response but also adjust how information is delivered to the user, greatly simplifying an increasingly complex computing world. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Smart Machines: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Deep analytics applied to an understanding of context provide the preconditions for a world of smart machines. This foundation combines with advanced algorithms that allow systems to understand their environment, learn for themselves, and act autonomously. Prototype autonomous vehicles, advanced robots, virtual personal assistants and smart advisors already exist and will evolve rapidly, ushering in a new age of machine helpers. The smart machine era will be the most disruptive in the history of IT. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Cloud/Client Computing: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The convergence of cloud and mobile computing will continue to promote the growth of centrally coordinated applications that can be delivered to any device. <a>quot;Cloud is the new style of elastically scalable, self-service computing, and both internal applications and external applications will be built on this new style,<a>quot; said Mr. Cearley. <a>quot;While network and bandwidth costs may continue to favor apps that use the intelligence and storage of the client device effectively, coordination and management will be based in the cloud.<a>quot; <br/> <s>In the near term, the focus for cloud/client will be on synchronizing content and application state across multiple devices and addressing application portability across devices. Over time, applications will evolve to support simultaneous use of multiple devices. The second-screen phenomenon today focuses on coordinating television viewing with use of a mobile device. In the future, games and enterprise applications alike will use multiple screens and exploit wearables and other devices to deliver an enhanced experience. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Software-Defined Applications and Infrastructure: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Agile programming of everything from applications to basic infrastructure is essential to enable organizations to deliver the flexibility required to make the digital business work. Software-defined networking, storage, data centers and security are maturing. Cloud services are software-configurable through API calls, and applications, too, increasingly have rich APIs to access their function and content programmatically. To deal with the rapidly changing demands of digital business and scale systems up â€” or down â€” rapidly, computing has to move away from static to dynamic models. Rules, models and code that can dynamically assemble and configure all of the elements needed from the network through the application are needed. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Web-Scale IT: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Web-scale IT is a pattern of global-class computing that delivers the capabilities of large cloud service providers within an enterprise IT setting. More organizations will begin thinking, acting and building applications and infrastructure like Web giants such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. Web-scale IT does not happen immediately, but will evolve over time as commercial hardware platforms embrace the new models and cloud-optimized and software-defined approaches reach mainstream. The first step toward the Web-scale IT future for many organizations should be DevOps â€” bringing development and operations together in a coordinated way to drive rapid, continuous incremental development of applications and services. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Risk-Based Security and Self-Protection: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>All roads to the digital future lead through security. However, in a digital business world, security cannot be a roadblock that stops all progress. Organizations will increasingly recognize that it is not possible to provide a 100 percent secured environment. Once organizations acknowledge that, they can begin to apply more-sophisticated risk assessment and mitigation tools. On the technical side, recognition that perimeter defense is inadequate and applications need to take a more active role in security gives rise to a new multifaceted approach. Security-aware application design, dynamic and static application security testing, and run-time application self-protection combined with active context-aware and adaptive access controls are all needed in today<r>s dangerous digital world. This will lead to new models of building security directly into applications. Perimeters and firewalls are no longer enough; every app needs to be self-aware and self-protecting. <br/> <s>Content from http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2867917'),

Each nerve cell has links with many others, but the strongest bonds form between the few cells most similar to each other. The results are published in the journal Nature. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Nerve cells form a bewildering mesh-work of connections called synapses -- up to several thousand per cell. Yet not all synaptic connections are equal. The overwhelming majority of connections are weak, and cells make only very few strong links. <a>quot;We wanted to see if there are rules that explain how neurons connect in complex networks comprising millions of neurons,<a>quot; says Professor Thomas Mrsic-Flogel, the leader of the research team from the Biozentrum (University of Basel) and UCL (University College London). <a>quot;It turns out that one of the rules is quite simple. Like-minded neurons are strongly coupled, while neurons that behave very differently from each other connect weakly or not at all.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Strong connections between close friends: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The researchers focused on the visual area of the cerebral cortex, which receives information from the eye and gives rise to visual perception. Neurons in this part of the brain respond to particular visual patterns, but it is difficult to untangle which cells are synaptically connected because there are many thousands of them densely packed (close to 100,000 per cubic millimeter). <br/> <s>Using a combination of high resolution imaging and sensitive electrical measurements, the researchers found that connections between nearby neurons are organized like a social network. Sites like Facebook keep us in contact with large numbers of acquaintances, but most people have a much smaller circle of close friends. These are usually the friends with which we have most in common, and their opinions can be more important to us than the views of the rest. <br/> <s><a>quot;Weak contacts in the brain have little impact, despite being in the majority,<a>quot; says Mrsic-Flogel. <a>quot;The few strong connections from neurons with similar functions exert the strongest influence on the activity of their partners.

Again, the same question come into existence of the definition of program segment clone itself. In so many instances, one canâ€™t be sure that some program fragment is copied from another. There are lots of code clones in software systems and â€œcopy paste modifyâ€ programming approaches are common method in software development as said by (Li <a>amp; Sun, 2010). This kind of behavior is wrong, hard to assure and not well established as genuine so it will produce software maintenance difficulties including but not limited to the specified: Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Â â€¢ Program code fragment obstacles spread out wider and quicker. It becomes more worst if the programmer is not having knowledge of these similarities. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> <s>Â Â â€¢ Program code fragment logical consistent across having the same code slices is volatile. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> <s>Â Â â€¢ Program code fragment increase without any necessity which lifts the effort of understands the system. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> <s>Â Â â€¢ Code fragment cloning rises the size of software systemâ€™s there by putting a strain on system resource, it Â degrade the overall functioning in terms of execution time and execution of space requirement also degrade performance of compilation time requirements. Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> <s>Â Â Without knowing about how and where the fragments of code are reused, if there are bugs in any fragment, that bugs will also be reflected in the reused fragments. Thus it becomes essential from maintenance point of view to know which parts within the code are copied or reused. Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Â There exists some different techniques to detect clone which have good precision but poor recall and vice versa. Some techniques are scalable while other has fast detection time. Most of the techniques are limited to small programs only. Some are infeasible for larger programs and detects only exact clones. So, there is a need for an efficient clone detection technique in larger programs that can deal with different type of clones. Â  Â  <br/> <s>Â Â  Â  <br/> <s>Â Â There are many code clone detection techniques each having its own advantages and disadvantages. These techniques are Text based, Token-based, Abstract Syntax tree based, Metric based and Program dependency graph (PDG) based detection technique. Most of the existing hybrid techniques used abstract syntax tree-based detection (AST) and program dependency graph (PDG). The complexity of comparison approach in these techniques increases with rise in the size of the code. The metric based detection technique is more scalable and accurate for large software system. Token based technique can find up to Type 3 clones with high accuracy and confidence. Also, hashing always reduces the complexity of any algorithm. Thus, if hashing is integrated with token based clone detection technique, the complexity of comparison will definitely reduce. '),

By detecting clones, the computation cost and complexity of the software system can be minimized. Because of these factors software clone detection is new and an important research area. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1)	Textual based approach <br/> <s>2)	Token based approach <br/> <s>3)	Abstract syntax tree approach <br/> <s>4)	Program dependency graph based approach <br/> <s>5)	Metric based approach <s><br/> <s>6)	Hybrid based approach <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. TEXTUAL BASED APPROACH: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Two program code fragments are comparing with each other to find matched sequence of text or strings. If match is found then code is a clone pair by the detection technique. Some popular tool that are used for this technique are Duploc (Ducasse, et al., 1999), DuDe (Wettel <a>amp; Marinescu, 2005), Simian (Rattan, et al., 2013), SDD (Similar data detection) (Lee, 2005), NICAD (Roy <a>amp; Cordy, 2008) (Roy, 2009). Duploc is languages independent clone detection tool in which no parsing required. DuDe is line based clone detection tool. Line base comparisons are done by using dynamic pattern matching and result is display in sort of dot plot (Rattan, et al., 2013). Simian is used to find clone in different programming language. If Simian is does not able to distinguish programming language of the actual file, then it treat it as a plain text files to detect clones. SDD is used for detecting code clone in large size systems. Nicad is a text based hybrid clone detection tool and it is able to find near-miss clones. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. TOKEN BASED APPROACH: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>It needs a parser or lexical analysis to normalize the code in form of token. So every line of source code is converted into token then comparison applied on intermediate representation. The sequences of lines are compared through different algorithms. This technique is slower than text based approach and it is more robust. Some popular tools that are used for this technique are CCFinder (Kamiya, et al., 2002), CP-Miner (Lu, et al., 2006), FCFinder (Sasaki, et al., 2010), CCFinderX (Kamiya, n.d.), ConQAT (Juergens, et al., 2010)etc. CCFinder (Code Clone Finder) uses a suffix tree matching algorithm to detect similar subsequence. CP-Miner uses frequent item-set mining to find bugs in the software made by cloning. FCFinder uses hashing to detect clones which are copied across projects. FCFinder took a long time to detect file clones in the 10GB collection. CCFinderX is used to study code clone genealogies at release level. It is also used it for analysis of the relation between open source software quality and code cloning. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE APPROACH: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The actual source code is parsed into abstract syntax tree (AST) or parse tree and traverse the tree for finding similar sub tree. If match is found for sub tree is termed as clone. AST representation better understands but very complex to create an abstract syntax tree and expensive process on both time and memory. Some popular tool that are used for this technique are CloneDR (Baxter, et al., 1998), Deckard (Jiang, et al., 2007), SimScan, and ClemanX (Nguyen, et al., 2009). CloneDR is used to find exact and near-miss clone by taking help of hashing and dynamic programming. SimScan is variation of CloneDR. Deckard is used for computing characteristics vector from AST and clustering vector. It is also used to finding refactoring on parts of a clone in open source systems. <s> <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. PROGRAM DEPENDENCY GRAPH BASED APPROACH: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>It shows the control flow and data dependencies. When PDG is obtained from source code an isomorphic graph comparison is applied to find similarity. PDG contains the control flow and data flow information of a program and hence carries semantic information. After obtain a set of PDGs are obtained from a subject program, isomorphic subgraph matching algorithm is applied for finding similar subgraphs which are returned as clones. For big software it is very difficult to obtain PDG. Some popular tool that are used for this technique are Duplix (Krinke, 2001), PDG-DUP (Komondoor, 2001), and Scorpio etc. (Rattan, et al., 2013). Duplix works on the k-limiting approach of finding maximal similar subgraphs. PDG-DUP is also a PDG-based tool which uses program slicing to find isomorphic graphs. It also helps in detecting non-contiguous. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. METRIC BASED APPROACH: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Instead of comparing code directly calculate metric from source code are obtained and these metric are compared to detect clone. To calculate metric there are many software that are used such as Columbus, Source Monitor, Datrix etc. This technique is more salable and accurate for big software system. Some popular tool that are used for this technique are CLAN (Patenaude, et al., 1999), Columbus, Source monitor, Mossegager (BÂ¨uhler, 2003), Datrix, and MCD Finder etc. The metric which are extracted from source code are compared to assess similarity. CLAN is one of the first approach to compare metrics obtained from an AST of source code. CLAN widely used in the last decade. Columbus is the tool which provides metrics that are useful in detecting clones, but this tool does not work for JAVA programs. The tool available for calculating JAVA code metrics is Source Monitor (Bhide, 2009) but the metrics provided by this tool are not efficient in providing the result of code clone detection. Datrix tool is available for calculating JAVA code metrics are highly complex, which are designed for extending the quality of JAVA code (Patenaude, et al., 1999). MCD Finder is a tool that are useful for predicting clones in the JAVA software and it is easy to use. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. HYBRID BASED APPROACH: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Hybrid based clone detection technique is quite complex but it is very effective technique for detecting clones in software artifacts as compare to above said technique. In this techniques two or more existing clone detection technique are combined to find clone of code. Clone detection technique that uses combinations of syntactic and semantic characteristic is called hybrid clone detection technique. PDG (Ferrante, et al., 1987) contains the control flow and data flow information of a program and hence carries semantic information. Once a set of PDGs are obtained from a subject program, isomorphic subgraph matching algorithm is applied for finding similar subgraphs which are returned as clones. There are some tools such as PDG-DUP, Duplix and Scorpio etc. Duplix (Kim, et al., 2006) works on the k-limiting approach of finding maximal minimal subgraphs. PDG-DUP (Karp <a>amp; Richard, 1986) is also a PDG based tool which uses program slicing to find isomorphic subgraphs. <s>It also helps in detecting non-contiguous clones. Scorpio applied for two way slicing to detect clones. The tool currently works on for JAVA and is based on number of PDG specialization for JAVA language and heuristics to speed up the overall detection process.'),

Every data structure has its own advantages: Some are good for fast retrieval, some for efficient search, some for quick insertions and deletions, and so on. <br/> <s>Today, hardware manufacturers are making computer chips faster by giving them more cores, or processing units. But while some data structures are well adapted to multicore computing, others are not. In principle, doubling the number of cores should double the efficiency of a computation. With algorithms that use a common data structure called a priority queue, thatâ€™s been true for up to about eight cores â€” but adding any more cores actually causes performance to plummet. <br/> <s>At the Association for Computing Machineryâ€™s Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming in February, researchers from MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will describe a new way of implementing priority queues that lets them keep pace with the addition of new cores. In simulations, algorithms using their data structure continued to demonstrate performance improvement with the addition of new cores, up to a total of 80 cores. <br/> <s>A priority queue is a data structure that, as its name might suggest, sequences data items according to priorities assigned them when theyâ€™re stored. At any given time, only the item at the front of the queue â€” the highest-priority item â€” can be retrieved. Priority queues are central to the standard algorithms for finding the shortest path across a network and for simulating events, and theyâ€™ve been used for a host of other applications, from data compression to network scheduling. <br/> <s>With multicore systems, however, conflicts arise when multiple cores try to access the front of a priority queue at the same time. The problem is compounded by modern chipsâ€™ reliance on caches â€” high-speed memory banks where cores store local copies of frequently used data. <br/> <s><a>quot;As you are reading the front of the queue, the whole front of the queue will be in your cache,â€ says Justin Kopinsky, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and one of the new paperâ€™s co-authors. â€œAll of these guys try to put the first element in their cache and then do a bunch of stuff with it, but then somebody writes to it, and it invalidates everybody elseâ€™s cache. And this is like an order-of-magnitude slowdown â€” maybe multiple orders of magnitude.<a>quot; <br/> <s>Loosening up: <br/> <s>To avoid this problem, Kopinsky; fellow graduate student Jerry Li; their advisor, professor of computer science and engineering Nir Shavit; and Microsoft Researchâ€™s Dan Alistarh, a former student of Shavitâ€™s, relaxed the requirement that each core has to access the first item in the queue. If the items at the front of the queue can be processed in parallel â€” which must be the case for multicore computing to work, anyway â€” they can simply be assigned to cores at random. <br/> <s>But a core has to know where to find the data item itâ€™s been assigned, which is harder than it sounds. Data structures generally trade ease of insertion and deletion for ease of addressability. You could, for instance, assign every position in a queue its own memory address: To find the fifth item, you would simply go to the fifth address. <br/> <s>But then, if you wanted to insert a new item between, say, items four and five, youâ€™d have to copy the last item in the queue into the first empty address, then copy the second-to-last item into the address you just vacated, and so on, until youâ€™d vacated address five. Priority queues are constantly being updated, so this approach is woefully impractical. <br/> <s>An alternative is to use whatâ€™s known as a linked list. Each element of a linked list consists of a data item and a â€œpointerâ€ to the memory address of the next element. Inserting a new element between elements four and five is then just a matter of updating two pointers. <br/> <s>Road less traveled: <br/> <s>The only way to find a particular item in a linked list, however, is to start with item one and follow the ensuing sequence of pointers. This is a problem if multiple cores are trying to modify data items simultaneously. Say that a core has been assigned element five. It goes to the head of the list and starts working its way down. But another core is already in the process of modifying element three, so the first core has to sit and wait until itâ€™s done. <br/> <s>The MIT researchers break this type of logjam by repurposing yet another data structure, called a skip list. The skip list begins with a linked list and builds a hierarchy of linked lists on top of it. Only, say, half the elements in the root list are included in the list one layer up the hierarchy. Only half the elements in the second layer are included in the third, and so on. <br/> <s>The skip list was designed to make moving through a linked list more efficient. To find a given item in the root list, you follow the pointers through the top list until you identify the gap into which it falls, then move down one layer and repeat the process. <br/> <s>But the MIT researcher<r>s algorithm starts farther down the hierarchy; how far down depends on how many cores are trying to access the root list. Each core then moves some random number of steps and jumps down to the next layer of the hierarchy. It repeats the process until it reaches the root list. Collisions can still happen, particularly when a core is modifying a data item that appears at multiple levels of the hierarchy, but they become much rarer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> The original article was written by Larry Hardesty https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/new-priority-queues-data-structure-0130 <br/> <s>Reviewed http://phys.org/news/2015-01-parallelize-common-multicore-chips.html'),

Like all good science fiction, the results riff off things that are already shimmering in the real world. And like all good science fiction, some of them are more than a little bonkers. A nice twist? You can buy them all, with profits going toward researchers working in that particular area. Here, take a look at 16 objects that donâ€™t exist yet â€¦ but might. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. A robot frog to replace those wiped out by disease: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The artificial, bio-robotic â€œAnura-43â€³ frog replaces flesh-and-blood counterparts that had become extinct by 2050. Sadly, the loss isnâ€™t entirely that unlikely: as The Guardian has reported, a fungus epidemic first threatened frogs in Costa Rica in 1987 and it now threatens nearly 3,000 amphibian species. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. A gizmo to design your children (and your childrenâ€™s children): <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Genetic engineering has provided the basis of much moral handwringing and discussion (see this interview with ethics professor Julian Savulescu). By 2050, concepts such as genetic terrorism and â€œsterility suicide bombersâ€ will likely have become unnervingly familiar. The â€œClean Gene Machineâ€ allows people to visualize and understand all the genetic permutations that could result from their reproducing â€” and be rid of any unwanted glitches that might result in their children being infertile. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. A robotic drone to bring you â€¦ yogurt: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Even by 2015, companies were excitedly trumpeting the potential of drones (or â€œunmanned aerial vehicles,â€ as their makers would rather you called them) to transform lives for the better or, at least, bring you stuff now. (See the TED playlist Will drones save us or destroy us?) By 2050, the â€œDro-Yoâ€ could do both through the drone-delivery of yogurt. Why yogurt? Because it might just be the healthiest thing out there. In 2013, Yovivo wanted to use synthetic biology to amp up yogurtâ€™s naturally healthy properties and include clones of resveratrol, the molecule commonly found in red wine that lowers bad cholesterol and improves circulation. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Cookie dough that deflects drones: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Because drones will be everywhere, weâ€™ll also need a way to escape them. Eat the â€œDrone Detection Cookie Doughâ€ and a combination of spider web technology and quartz crystals projects a magical personal biosphere to make you invisible. Downside: this product could make everyone very, very fat. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s perhaps lucky this one wasnâ€™t based on much more than wishful thinking. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. A way to extract gold from sea water: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>According to researchers, â€œmarine water is one of the richest sources of gold in nature.â€ The issue: how to get at it. Using principles of biomimicry, the â€œGold Oysterâ€ borrows the way that regular oysters filter their food from water, only it would filter and extract gold particles (for use in phones, etc). <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. Contraception that screens embryos: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The â€œNext Choice Inheritâ€ device analyzes embryos and implants only those without genetic predisposition to disease. Ray Kurzweil would be proud. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7. A sustainable way to build in space: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In 2014, International Space Station commander Barry Wilmore 3D-printed a ratchet while floating in space, so who knows what weâ€™ll be printing up there by 2050? Another development to track â€” the use of microbes to catalyze life-sustaining products we wonâ€™t want to haul to space. â€œSpacecreteâ€ uses astronaut waste and microbes to bond rocks and dust into a sustainable building material. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>8. The means to knock off a mosquito: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The â€œTele-squitoâ€ allows you to capture mosquitoes, extract their genes and then implant them into other mosquitoes. Why would you want to do this, you ask yourself? There are good reasons. Really. As Michael Specter (TED Talk: The danger of science denial) reported in the New Yorker in 2012, the firm Oxitec has been working on a way to modify the dengue-carrying Aedes mosquito so that the mutant version essentially destroys its own species. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>9. An orchestra played by bugs: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>â€œThe Critter Orchestraâ€ basically means you could program small animals (insects, frogs, etc.) to play music. Once again, this crazy-sounding idea is rooted in reality: as Ed Yong (TED Talk: Zombie roaches and other parasite tales) has detailed, the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii can cause personality changes in its host, not always to as benign effect as getting it to bang out â€œYankee Doodle Dandyâ€ â€¦ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>10. A device to record memories: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The â€œVirtusenseâ€ directly connects to your brain via the neck. Why? To capture and retain memories that otherwise might be lost to time. (Given increased life expectancy, weâ€™ll all have a lot to remember.) One interesting question â€” what happens when the device is separated from the person? Will we be able to borrow or buy someone elseâ€™s experiences? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>11. An energy carbon credit calculator â€¦ that pays off the national debt: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>â€œBy 2039, federal debt held by the public would reach 106 percent of GDP, more than in any year except 1946,â€ estimated an uncheering 2014 report from the Congressional Budget Office. The â€œWattexchangeâ€ helps to offset this alarming number via a calculator that allows individuals to buy and sell carbon credits. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>12. A way to mess with someoneâ€™s memories: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>â€œNightmare Fuelâ€ is a way to replace someoneâ€™s perfectly happy memories with, well, with nightmares. Riffing off the 2013 discovery by scientists at MIT that we have a gene that replaces old memories with new ones, this product is the bad, bad application of that insight. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>13. A way to overwrite your driverless carâ€™s fateful decisions: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The â€œEthx Overwriteâ€ is an add-on for Tesla cars (the 2040 driverless models). It allows drivers to bypass the carâ€™s decisions, such as the one deciding which driver would die in an unavoidable fatal accident. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>14. A way to test whether life is sustainable: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This small machine, known as an â€œExo-Life,â€ uses organisms to see whether life in new environments on exoplanets and space stations is viable or not. This riffs off research from NASA and others that would allow pioneers to â€œbuild a Mars base with a box of engineered bugs.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>15. A custom-made pill to change your personality: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Forget the gym. Never mind meditation. The â€œMicro-mindâ€ is a microbial supplement to change your personality in any way you like. (In 2013, scientists posited that the makeup of bacteria in the human might affect not only body weight but also the brain.) <br/> <s> <br/> <s>16. A cleaner that eats dirt and dust: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Whoâ€™s to say that James Dyson and his merry band of inventors in the UK arenâ€™t already working on a vacuum cleaner thatâ€™s, you know, alive? The â€œDyson DC99 Cobraâ€ is a living, hanging organism that resembles a plant â€” and eats hair and dust to minimize cleaning and maximize sparkliness. <br/> <s>Reference and Pics: http://ideas.ted.com/16-objects-you-might-find-in-a-pawn-shop-in-2050/'),

If you live 78 years, 28.3 of those you will be asleep. So what? If your startup finds a way to improve sleep, your customers will be using your product every day, for 1/3 of their lives.

If you<r>re just getting started on your coding journey, here are ten tips and resources to set you off on the right foot. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 1. Figure Out Why You Want to Learn to Code: <s><br/> <s>Â The direction you go in will depend in large part on why you want to learn to code in the first place and how much time you have to devote to learning. If you want to be a professional programmer, signing up college courses might be your best bet. (Google has a list of suggested skills and courses for would-be software engineers.) If you want to build websites or games for fun (and possibly profit) in your spare time, interactive tutorials might be better. Bloc has a comparison of course options based on workload, cost, and reason you<r>re picking up programming. And if you<r>re still deciding on a tech career, Switch will recommend one based on your interests. Â  <br/> http://lifehacker.com/the-tech-skills-and-courses-google-recommends-for-softw-1660157164 <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 2. Choose the Right Language: <s><br/> <s>Â There<r>s no one <a>quot;best<a>quot; programming language, and once you<r>ve learned one, it<r>s fairly easy to pick up another, so don<r>t get hung too up on choosing your first language. That said, some languages are more beginner-friendly than others. The language you choose to start with might depend, again, on your purpose. (For example, if you want to write an iOS app, you<r>ll need to learn Swift.) There<r>s a case for starting with C if you<r>re serious about programming, although higher-level languages, like Python, are easier to jump into right away. <br/> http://lifehacker.com/5401954/programmer-101-teach-yourself-how-to-code Â  <br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 3. Start Small (and Be Patient): <s><br/> <s>Â No matter which language or learning method you choose, you should start at the very beginning (a very good place to start). When David Sinsky taught himself to code in eight weeks, for example, he spent one weekend getting an introductory grasp of Python and one weekend getting an introductory understanding of Djangoâ€”going through the tutorial, deleting all of the tutorial code, and working through the tutorial again from scratch. Start with the basics and be patient with yourself as you progress. To take your first coding project from start to finish, break down the project into simple steps. And if one method of learning isn<r>t working for you (e.g., books), try another method before giving up. <s><br/> http://lifehacker.com/how-i-taught-myself-to-code-in-eight-weeks-511615189 <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 4. Try a Kids App: <s><br/> <s>Â Even toddlers are learning to code these days. That<r>s actually a great thing for all of us. Although many of the programs designed to teach kids to code are very simplistic, many of them, like Scratch, are suitable for all ages. It doesn<r>t matter how old you are; even kids<r> animation apps can get you started with the basics of programming (edX has a new course on Programming in Scratch, by the way). <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 5. Use Free Online Training Sites: <s><br/> <s>Â Free online training sites like Codecademy and other Hour of Code participants can help you write your first computer program. Tutorials from KhanAcademy, Codecademy, Code.org, and many other organizations will introduce you to the basics of programmingâ€”all while creating a new game, site, or other project. Find the resources you need according to the language you<r>re learning with Bento. These are good starting points, but you<r>ll need to take the initiative to further or continue your learning after these introductions. <s><br/> http://lifehacker.com/bento-showcases-the-best-resources-for-learning-to-code-1450016607 <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 6. Â Take a Coding Course: <s><br/> <s>Â Online computer science courses offer a bit more of rounded educational experience compared to online training sites focusing on one language. These courses are designed to teach you fundamental skills over several months in college-level classes. I can<r>t personally recommend Harvard<r>s CS50 (which you can take for free) enough, but there are many others you can take (many listed on our Lifehacker U series). You can even build a college-level computer science education with this selection of fifteen online courses. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 7. Grab Some Free Programming Books: <s><br/> <s>Â When you get stuck on a problem or just need to look something up, reference books come in very handy. There<r>s a huge collection of over 500 free programming books posted on GitHub, and another collection of Ebooks covering 24 programming languages. <s><br/> http://lifehacker.com/grab-over-500-free-programming-books-from-github-1447805132 <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 8. Play Coding Games: <s><br/> <s>Â Often the best way to learn is through games. While plenty of coding tutorials have you building simple or complex games yourself, a couple of teaching sites are literally games: Code Combat and CodinGame are two you might have fun with. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 9. Get a Mentor (or Teach Someone Else): <s><br/> <s>Â The programming community is full of people who are willing to help the next generation of programmers. Hack.pledge() is one site that will connect you to a mentor, or you can sign up to mentor someone else. Even just planning to teach what you<r>ve learned can help you retain the information better. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 10. Hack Someone Else<r>s Code: <s><br/> <s>Â When you reverse engineer someone else<r>s code, testing each line to see how it works, you get a better understanding of the big picture. Thanks to tons of open source code, you can learn just about anythingâ€”and keep learning through the incremental-hacking cycle. Just remember to share your code back with the community if you improve on a program. <br/> http://lifehacker.com/learn-to-code-by-breaking-someone-elses-code-1442438673 <s><br/> An article from http://lifehacker.com'),

And to come clear of this level, here are 6 things that you should definitely do to make that impression! <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 1. Google Yourself : <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â We all know that almost all of the good potential employers first Google their job candidates. So go on and Google yourself and see what they have to say about you. Research not only saves you from appearing unprepared if your interviewer refers to something they saw online but also helps you know what image you have out there. Â  <br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 2. Fix your online image: <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â So you searched for your name and the results were not quite impressive or infact were deteriorating your image, well then it<r>s time to work on your online presence. Yes, you can handle what people see about you online. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â a. Use Me on the Web to understand and manage what people see when they search for you on Google. <s><br/> <s>Â b. Use SEO tricks to boost your resumes and professional pages. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 3. Research about the location beforehand: <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Your job location is indeed one important factor. Before you visit the office for the interview, do research about the location of the workplace. This will help you in deciding if you really want to travel that much daily to your workplace and will also help you in reaching for the interview in time. Remember first impression is the last impression. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 4. Research about your company: <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Just a quick glimpse on the company profile isn<r>t enough to create the impression. Go deep into the company data using Google, social media etc. This will not only help you understand the culture of the company but will also give you a lot of content to talk about on the interview. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 5. Ask questions!: <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â The belief that asking questions can leave a bad impression is really-really old school. Today, if you come out of the interview without asking any question about the company or the profile or the job, you might be considered uninterested. Always prepare some questions in your mind beforehand. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â 6. Send a thanks note!: <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â Yes, this is an <r>after<r> interview thing, and also sounds a little unconventional, but trust us, writing back is a good idea. It creates a lasting impression and lets the employer remember your name clearly which can result into a job offer.

Jumpstart IoT is a platform that carriers can use to provide value added services to enterprise customers, who can use the system for greater efficiencies in areas such as inventory management with the use of automated sensors that can send updates using the cellular network. <s><br/> <s>Â In the run-up to the Nasscom India Leadership Forum taking place in Mumbai this week, we spoke to Jagdish Mitra, Head Mobility Business and Large Deals, Tech Mahindra, who talked at length about the company<r>s role in the Internet of Things space, and how we are going to see both consumer level products, and smart cities, both of which leverage the concept of IoT. <s><br/> <s>Â <a>quot;The consumer market [for cellular networks] in India is a pretty mature market,<a>quot; says Mitra, <a>quot;so today, the carriers need to sell to enterprise. For example, Airtel would want to sell a system that uses its network to a retail logistics company, that would automate the tracking of their packages from start to finish.<a>quot; <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â <a>quot;Jumpstart is our IoT platform, and it essentially allows the carriers to create value added services like that by connecting the sensors to the cloud,<a>quot; he explains. <a>quot;So we create the technology setup for Airtel, and they can then find the clients who have use cases for this and provide the necessary bandwidth.<a>quot; <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â The same can be said about the Internet of Things as well - like a Smart TV, adding Internet access and sensors to devices can increase their functionality in a number of ways. This can mean a lot of different things though. We could have smart devices that react to our needs before we even realize we wanted something done - a Google Now for the real world - or we could see smart cities, where the power, traffic and other citywide systems are connected and able to improve efficiency. In both cases, the result could be the same. <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â <a>quot;A smart thermostat that adjusts the temperature of your house is one way to save energy using IoT,<a>quot; explains Mitra, <a>quot;But the other way to do it is to monitor the energy needs of the city, and provide it more efficiently from the grid, reducing waste at a macro level. Similarly, a connected car could be loaded with sensors to provide a safer, faster journey, or we could gather traffic data at the city level and provide every car with the information it needs.<a>quot; <s><br/> <s>Â  <s><br/> <s>Â What<r>s perhaps most interesting is how this technology comes together at the macro level. As Mitra points out, what<r>s needed for a smart city will vary around the world. Tech Mahindra is currently involved in smart city projects around the world, and he explains that the work it is doing in Milton Keynes in the UK is going to be very different from what it does in Jaipur. <s><br/> <s>Â See more at: http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/features/building-the-internet-of-things-in-india-658716 <s><br/> http://deity.gov.in/content/internet-things <s><br/> http://yourstory.com/2015/01/internet-of-things-2015/'),

That myth is not exactly true. <s>Most marketers choose the career because they enjoy the energy of a dynamic environment, and have skills in creative, planning and project management. Increasingly, people come into the new world of modern marketing because they enjoy math, science and analysis. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The explosion of big data across all market segments has led to the need for a more analytical approach to marketing. Understanding the big trends behind the cloud and big data phenomenon and some of the resulting major trends in marketing will empower the CMO of the future. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. <s>Computing is now a utility. As a cheap utility much like electricity, cloud computing is enabling a whole new breed of uses, applications and appliances. <s>This is perfect for marketing because it enables rapid iteration, experimentation and, ultimately, more success. <s>It also enables pay-as-you-go marketing services for software-as-a-service (SaaS) basis that is friendly to a marketerâ€™s budget. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. <s>Mobile is everywhere. Mobile computing is cheap, pervasive and increasingly high performance. <s>Now, even menial tasks such as ordering food (Door Dash, Order Ahead) or getting a ride (Uber, Lyft) are being mobilized and showing remarkable growth rates. <s>Expect more of these revolutionary apps just as we saw when the Internet first became ubiquitous. <s>Marketers are building â€œmobile firstâ€ or â€œmobile onlyâ€ websites to optimize for the new demand. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. <s>Big Data is expanding yet accessible. With much of humanity now having cheap, connected mobility combined with new cool apps and a tech savvy millennial demographic, big data is exploding. Big data means a big opportunity for companies who are gathering new outputs from new users and new uses. <s>Tools are needed to analyze the flood of data pouring into the enterprise. Savvy CMOs recognize this and are investing in data analysis and marketing cloud technologies. Some are even hiring data scientists within the marketing group. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Enterprise marketing technologies are moving to the cloud. According to Scott Brinker from ChiefMartec.com, there are now close to 2000 marketing technology vendors. <s>With the big data explosion and Amazon Web Services enabling cheap, easy-to-spin-up machines as a utility, smart technology vendors have shifted their business models to the cloud and built new enterprise application clouds. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. Predictive marketing helps tie it all together. Marketers need to embrace the math and science behind what powers the new marketing clouds, and not ignore lead generation or treat marketing automation as a â€œblack boxâ€. By leveraging the combination of both public and private data, marketers can create models to automatically identify trends such as lead scoring, fit, and buyer intent before the sale occurs.

Only technical knowledge is not required in an effective programmer. Here are the 10 traits which may define you as one of the most reliable programmers around. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. Learn new technical as well as non-technical aspects: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Programmers who learn only that much what is necessary can never grow in their career. Proactive learning of new skills â€“ both technical and non-technical â€“ beget good programmers. Effective programmers should have an open mind to all kinds of sources of knowledge. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Humility factor: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Humility implies all other attributes and enables them too. For a programmer humility means to understand the programming world doesn<r>t start or end with you. You should accept that you cannot know everything and there is always a scope to learn. Don<r>t ever consider yourself as expert in everything which may just stop your learning process and consequently your progress. So keep your ego aside while programming. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Intellect: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Always try to understand a problem, analyse it and then express your ideas in clear and readable codes. Intellect comprises analytical and logical mind in case you are a programmer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Be pragmatic: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Don<r>t follow rules of programming blindly and then only you can produce a working application. So always explore other possibilities while coding, moving out of the traditional rule-book. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. An eye for detail: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>An eye for detail is a necessary requirement for developing any software. Self-documenting, self-testing and paying attention to lots of detail is what you want to become a great programmer. Paying attention to details also means critical thinking which means you need to examine the details of your designs and implementation. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. Expertise: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>A good programmer should have enough knowledge and experience in order to solve any problem of the client in a specific context. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7. Proper research work: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>To find out answers, proper research work is required to solve the issues. You need to know the exact way of finding answers and discover root causes of your problems. Don<r>t waste your time in search engines and learn to perform root cause analysis. Learn about the underlying system to find out solutions. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>8. Adaptability: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Change will always be there, you just need to follow them, and get adapted as per your requirements. Software development projects are full of changes from the beginning point to end. So adaptability is highly required to avoid any kind of frustration. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>9. Maturity: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>A good programmer should be mature enough who knows how to use the best software development principles, practices and skills as per requirements. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>10. Passion: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Love your work, above and all. Don<r>t look at programming just as your job, but the love of your life. You must be passionate about what you<r>re doing, you must be excited about your job, the technology you<r>re using, your organisation, your project and so on. '),

According to the macro definition in the previous line the argument must be expanded so that the 4th,1st,3rd <a>amp; the 2nd characters must be merged. In the argument (a,n,i,m,a,t,e) 4th,1st,3rd <a>amp; the 2nd characters are â€˜mâ€™,â€™aâ€™,â€™iâ€™ <a>amp; â€˜nâ€™. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>So the third line â€œint beginâ€ is replaced by â€œint mainâ€ by the preprocessor before the program is passed on for the compiler.

No: <br/> <s>First of all, if asked even a simple question, you donâ€™t want to give a single word answer (yes or no). But when the answer is no, definitely donâ€™t leave it there! For example, if asked if you know a particular computer program, and you donâ€™t, you could say, â€œI haven<r>t yet had a chance to learn it but would be interested to do so,â€ rather than simply saying â€œNo.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Erâ€¦ Umâ€¦: <br/> <s>That old saying, â€œIf you donâ€™t have anything to say, donâ€™t say anything at all,â€ applies here a big. Rather than hemming and hawing while you try to think up an answer, just be silent and think. Saying er or um too much could make you seem unprepared or as though youâ€™re not paying attention. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Whatever, OMG, baeâ€¦ groovy?: <br/> <s>Lose the slang when talking to an interviewer. You want to come across as polished and professional, and you donâ€™t want them to have to dig out their urban dictionary to understand you. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Sure, cool, kindaâ€¦: <br/> <s>These kinds of words are just too casual, even in a casual workplace. You should be presenting the best version of yourself, not the sloppy, casual version. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. We: <br/> <s>This one seems innocuous at first, but if you use it a lot when discussing job duties and accomplishments, the interviewer might start to wonder if it was you or your team that was responsible. Try to use â€œIâ€ as much as possible. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. Dedicated, motivated, team player...: <br/> <s>Lose the resume speech and jargon. Besides the fact that these words are incredibly overused in interview situations, theyâ€™re also better demonstrated than just stated. If you want to convey your dedication or motivation, share an example from your past work experience; examples will go much further to making your claims believable. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7. Leverage, synergy, ideationâ€¦: <br/> <s>Iâ€™d avoid using too much business jargon. The chances that youâ€™ll come off sounding like an idiot are just too high. Too much business buzzwords or jargon tends to make people sound pretentious, or worse, downright stupid. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>8. <r>Hit the ground running,<r> <r>Circle backâ€¦<r>: <br/> <s>These kinds of cliches have little to no meaning, theyâ€™re just verbal fluff, and they donâ€™t add anything to what youâ€™re saying. So leave them out. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>9. Hate: <br/> <s>I canâ€™t think of a single instance when saying you â€œhateâ€ something in a job interview is appropriate, but itâ€™s exceptionally inappropriate to say anything about hating your former job, co-workers, boss, etc. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>10. Perfectionist: <br/> <s>Itâ€™s become almost a cliche in and of itself to answer a question like, â€œWhatâ€™s your biggest flaw?â€ with a positive flaw like, â€œIâ€™m a perfectionist.â€ Any good interviewer will see right through that, so just donâ€™t do it. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This would really helpful for cracking interview.

We draw, sing, build, and dream. Yet somewhere along the way, many peopleâ€™s creativity gets blocked, and we start to say, â€œIâ€™m not the creative type.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>If youâ€™re like most people I pose these questions to, your answers to both probably fall somewhere around good, pretty good, or very good. But you might also add that you could stand to do better. <br/> <s>Most organizations want to consistently do innovation. Executives and managers feel it is critical to the success of their organization or business. But even though they know it is necessary to survive, many donâ€™t know how to go about it. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Hereâ€™s one equation for innovation that I like: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Creativity * Execution = Innovation: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>A company may be able to execute, but without creativity there is no innovation. The same holds true for creative organizations that lack the ability to execute. <br/> <s>Design thinking is taught at the d.school as a five-stage process. It starts with developing empathy for your user and goes on to defining the problem, brainstorming potential solutions, rapidly prototyping one or more of those proposed solutions, and then testing that prototype with your user. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>A new concept has emerged out of the d.school, however. Itâ€™s called creative confidence, and I think it better captures what organizations need to establish or grow their innovation capacity. Creative confidence is what design thinking brings to an organization. <br/> <s>I often find people believe innovation is about problem solving. Really though, innovation is about problem finding.

In five years at the helm of cancer drug developer Onyx Pharmaceuticals he increased its market cap eightfold by purchasing an experimental blood cancer drug for $800 million, developing it into a big seller and flipping the whole company to Amgen for $10.4 billion in October 2013. He personally made $60 million on the deal. Biotech watchers expected him to start another cancer company or even command a drug giant like Merck or Pfizer. <br/> <s>Instead, Coles, 54, is using his own money to build a Cambridge, Mass.-based startup called Yumanity that is using yeast, the microbes that help make bread and beer, to study how misfolded proteins in the brain cause Alzheimerâ€™s, Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s, and to create drugs based on that knowledge. Thereâ€™s already interest from Big Pharma. Coles says he chose to attack brain diseases, not tumors, because the need is so dire and the science is so fresh. <br/> <s>Read full article at: http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/02/11/brain-boom-the-drug-companies-bringing-neuroscience-back-from-the-brink/'),

While anyone can be a script kid, generally <s>who want the power of the hacker without the discipline or training involved. A script kid is not looking to target specific information or a specific company but rather uses knowledge of a vulnerability to scan the entire Internet for a victim that possesses that vulnerability. These kids are often portrayed by the media and other non-technically savvy parties as being very intelligent and having tremendous technical knowledge despite the fact that very few of these so-called <a>quot;hackers<a>quot; can write their own computer programs or even possess even the most rudimentary technical understanding of the underlying systems that they are attacking or using. The wide-spread and trivial availability of these scripts for <a>quot;hacking<a>quot; allows these kids to cause serious problems from time-to-time and thus they get themselves into trouble way out of proportion to their skill set. To leap to the assumption that one of these script kids has significant computer knowledge based on his ability to successfully execute scripts created by other people is equivalent to assuming that the functionally-illiterate 14 year old that shoots a clerk at a convenience store must be a physics expert because he managed to fire a gun. <br/> <s>Programmers: <br/> <s>Computer programmers write, test, debug, and maintain the detailed instructions, called computer programs, that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming â€” advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools â€” have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization. <s>Programmers are essential to the development of computers because without the coding that is necessary to make a computer work properly, the machine would be useless. Programmers may specialize in one area or may write instructions for a wide range of systems or programs. Programmer who cracks (gains unauthorized access to) computers, typically to do malicious things; <a>quot;crackers are often mistakenly called hackers<a>quot; called Cracker.

CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering (like sending a link via email/chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker<r>s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transfering funds, changing their email address, etc. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application. CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user<r>s browser <br/> <s> <br/> <s>CSRF attacks are also known by a number of other names, like XSRF, <a>quot;Sea Surf<a>quot;, Session Riding, Cross-Site Reference Forgery, and Hostile Linking and One-Click attack (Microsoft<r>s refer). <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Who discovered CSRF? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In the 1988 Norm Hardy published a document explaining an application level trust issue he called a confused deputy. In 2000 a post to bugtraq explained how ZOPE was affected by a confused-deputy web problem that we would define today as a CSRF vulnerability. Later in 2001 Peter Watkins posted an entry on the bugtraq mailing list coining the CSRF term in response to another thread titled The Dangers of Allowing Users to Post Images. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>What are common ways to perform a CSRF attack? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The most popular ways to execute CSRF attacks is by using a HTML image tag, or JavaScript image object.

Maria, an attacker, wants to trick Alice to send the money to her instead. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>The attack will comprise the following steps: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>building an exploit URL or script, <br/> <s>tricking Alice into executing the action with Social Engineering <br/> <s> <br/> <s>GET scenario: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>If the application was designed to primarily use GET requests to transfer parameters and execute actions, the money transfer operation might be reduced to a request like- <br/> <s> <br/> <s>GET http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=BOB<a>amp;amount=100 HTTP/1.1 <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Maria now decides to exploit this web application vulnerability using Alice as her victim. Maria first constructs the following exploit URL which will transfer $100,000 from Alice<r>s account to her account. She takes the original command URL and replaces the beneficiary name with herself, raising the transfer amount significantly at the same time- <br/> <s> <br/> <s>http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA<a>amp;amount=100000 <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The Social Engineering part of the attack will trick Alice to load this URL when she<r>s logged into the bank application. This is usually done with one of the following techniques- <br/> <s> <br/> <s>sending an unsolicited email with HTML content: <br/> <s>planting an exploit URL or script on pages that are likely to be visited by the victim while they are also doing online banking.: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The exploit URL can be disguised either as an ordinary link, encouraging the victim to click it- <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>lt;a href=<a>quot;http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA<a>amp;amount=100000<a>quot;<a>gt;View my Pictures!<a>lt;/a<a>gt; : <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Or by a 0x0 fake image: <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>lt;img src=<a>quot;http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=MARIA<a>amp;amount=100000<a>quot; width=<a>quot;0<a>quot; height=<a>quot;0<a>quot; border=<a>quot;0<a>quot;<a>gt; : <br/> <s> <br/> <s>If this image tag were included in the email, Alice wouldn<r>t see anything. However, the browser will still submit the request to bank.com without any visual indication that the transfer has taken place. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>A real life example of CSRF attack on an application using GET was uTorrent exploit from 2008 that was used on a mass scale to download malware. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>POST scenario: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The only difference when POST requests are being used is how the attack is being executed by the victim. Let<r>s assume the bank now uses POST and the vulnerable request looks like this- <br/> <s> <br/> <s>POST http://bank.com/transfer.do HTTP/1.1 <br/> <s> <br/> <s>acct=BOB<a>amp;amount=100 <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Such a request cannot be delivered using standard A or IMG tags, but can be delivered using a FORM tag- <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <a>lt;form action=<a>quot;http://bank.com/transfer.do<a>quot; method=<a>quot;POST<a>quot;<a>gt; <br/> <s> <s> <a>lt;input type=<a>quot;hidden<a>quot; name=<a>quot;acct<a>quot; value=<a>quot;MARIA<a>quot;/<a>gt; <br/> <s> <s> <a>lt;input type=<a>quot;hidden<a>quot; name=amount<a>quot; value=<a>quot;100000<a>quot;/<a>gt; <br/> <s> <s> <a>lt;input type=<a>quot;submit<a>quot; value=<a>quot;View my pictures<a>quot;/<a>gt; <br/> <s> <a>lt;/form<a>gt; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This form will require the user to click on the submit button, but this can be also executed automatically using JavaScript: <br/> <s> <br/> <s> <a>lt;body onload=<a>quot;document.forms[0].submit()<a>quot;<a>gt; <br/> <s> <a>lt;form... <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Prevention measures that do NOT work: <br/> <s> <br/> <s> Using a secret cookie: <br/> <s> <s> Remember that all cookies, even the secret ones, will be submitted with every request. All authentication tokens will be submitted regardless of whether or not the end-user was tricked into submitting the request. Furthermore, session identifiers are simply used by the application container to associate the request with a specific session object. The session identifier does not verify that the end-user intended to submit the request. <br/> <s> <s><br/> <s> Only accepting POST requests: <br/> <s> <s> Applications can be developed to only accept POST requests for the execution of business logic. The misconception is that since the attacker cannot construct a malicious POST request, a CSRF attack cannot be executed. Unfortunately, this logic is incorrect. There are numerous methods in which an attacker can trick a victim into submitting a forged POST request, such as a simple form hosted on the attacker<r>s website comprised entirely of hidden fields.

Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects. Design patterns mainly classified as Creational, Structural and Behavioural. <br/> <s>Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The Chain of Responsibility pattern avoids coupling the sender of a request to the receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. ATM use the Chain of Responsibility in money giving mechanism. <br/> <s>Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that contains many possible handlers. <br/> <s>An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal. <br/> <s>In a variation of the standard chain-of-responsibility model, some handlers may act as dispatchers, capable of sending commands out in a variety of directions, forming a tree of responsibility. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Problem: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>There is a potentially variable number of <a>quot;handler<a>quot; or <a>quot;processing element<a>quot; or <a>quot;node<a>quot; objects, and a stream of requests that must be handled. Need to efficiently process the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence, or request-to-handler mappings. <br/> <s>Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object should handle the request. <br/> <s>Chain of Responsibility simplifies object interconnections. Instead of senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate successor in the chain. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Structure: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests.

Given such a diverse suite of cognitive functions, you might expect the neocortex to implement an equally diverse suite of specialized neural algorithms. The neocortex displays a remarkably uniform pattern of neural circuitry. The biological evidence suggests that the neocortex implements a common set of algorithms to perform many different intelligence functions.

By pressing a bulb on the device, you can push the blood through the chip, which can test the sample, and after about 15 minutes, the results will appear on an app loaded on the phone. Over the span of two weeks, 96 patients from three health clinics participated, and researchers say the device performed about as well as commercially available diagnostic tools now used to run tests in the field.

The unfinished sperm fragments are then reabsorbed into the testis, never ending up in the semen. â€œIf there<r>s no sperm, the egg<r>s not going to get fertilized,â€ says Joseph Tash, a reproductive biologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center, who has worked on the compound since 2001. Almost two years ago, the FDA reviewed the compound, and now the agency wants Tash to investigate any crossover effects on the female body.

Cut it in half and youâ€™ll eventually end up with two hydra. Mix a bunch of them up in a test tube, break them all apart into single cells, and still theyâ€™ll re-form into a ball and split off as individuals. This is a supremely simple animal, belonging to the same group as jellyfish, the cnidarians. â€œI sometimes describe hydras sort of like a little free-living piece of intestine,â€ said hydrobiologist Rob Steele of the University of California, Irvine. At one end is a sticky disk, which the hydra uses to anchor itself, and at the other is a mouth and tentacles packed with stinging cells, which fire toxic harpoons into prey. Holding the quarry in place, the hydra then ratchets its mouth over the victimâ€”typically a tiny crustacean called a water fleaâ€”until itâ€™s entirely enveloped. Hydra reproduce asexually, budding off little clones, so Martinez had to pick those young out and toss them. After four years of this, not only were the hydra still alive, but they looked good as new. Four years may not sound like a long time, but the rule in nature is that the smaller you are, the shorter you live. Thus can small insects last only a matter of weeks, while blue whales keep ticking for nearly a century. Something the size of a hydra living for four years is just ridiculous. The average lifespan of hydra is six years. The hydra is thought to be potentially immortal. â€œTo say that itâ€™s immortal implies that there might actually be hydra running around that have lived for 10,000 years,â€ Steele said. â€œI donâ€™t know that thatâ€™s possible. But it has the potential from what we know about it for being immortal.â€ The hydraâ€™s secret seems to be that it sheds its entire body and starts from scratch every few weeks. Itâ€™s essentially just a sack of stem cells, which are kind of like blank slates. These eventually specialize into, say, a cell that makes up the tentacle. But the hydra will shed this cell after just a few days, keeping it from aging and wearing out like our own cells do. â€œIt doesnâ€™t have any cells that hang around long enough to get old and decrepit,â€ Steele said, â€œand therefore the individual doesnâ€™t get old and decrepit.<a>quot; <s>Why the hydra would evolve such a unique way of life is still a mystery.'),

Their system is able to generate the combustion force outside of the cylinder in a separate combustion chamber and then apply it directly to a rotor that is rotating around the engine constantly at the best possible pressure angle. In a Turbocombustion Engine, four complete cycles occur in every rotation, suction and expansion cycles occur simultaneously in half a rotation; compression and exhaust on the other half, allowing power stroke on every rotating cycle. Expansion capacity in a Turbocombustion Engine is much larger than the cylinder capacity (in this design by nearly 250%). This feature allows nearly the entire combustion force to convert to useful rotating energy as the force applied to the rotor<r>s firewall constantly tangential to its parameter (the best possible pressure angle) with a nearly 5-time leverage advantage compared to conventional IC Engines. Constant suction and compression by the piston eliminates the throw and, consequently, the vertical vibration. Since the expansion occurs outside of the cylinder, the pistonâ€™s weight is reduced to a minimum and is perfectly balanced with the crankshaft to minimize or eliminate the horizontal vibration. The Turbocombustion Engineâ€™s combustion chamber and cap are equipped with friction-free enhanced sealing mechanisms. The opening and closing of the cap over the combustion chamber is controlled by a pair of cams mounted on the crankshaft. The power stroke outside of the cylinder significantly diminishes oil deterioration, prolongs the moving parts life, and uniforms overall engine temperature. The Turbocombustion Engine also may include a computer-controlled VCR system to allow optimum performance of the engine under all atmospheric variations and fuel types. '),

When those energy suppliers wear down, the system will stop moving. Using a memory metal such as Nitinol seems to be the only well-studied exception, since the springing back motion of the metal intensifies--rather than diminishes--over thousands of repetitions. The V Gate Magnet Motor seems to run indefinitely as does the Spring-Loaded Cross Wheel. Also, a steel ball within a wheel being drawn toward a magnet just outside of it seems to turn the wheel indefinitely (until the magnet eventually wears out, of course). A man also found success using an electric water pump to spray the same cycling water downward to turn a paddle wheel that was connected to an electric generator with added capacitors and new bearings. The added energy in that system came from earth<r>s gravity adding force to the spraying water. In all four of these systems described, gravity<r>s limitless energy is being harnessed through the stored energy in the magnets or springs to continuously overcome friction within the system. No laws are being broken since energy is being supplied by two sources in each system.'),

Take Mars, for example. Though weâ€™ve successfully sent rovers to the planet, humans are a bit more tricky, Zirbel says. â€œJust to get from Earth to Mars, itâ€™s an eight month journey at the minimum,â€ she says, â€œand when we send a rover, we donâ€™t have to [use] a lot of power on the flight. They donâ€™t breathe, they donâ€™t really care if there are lights on or not, but if weâ€™re sending people, then [power] becomes a bigger concern.

First of all you should know your level of vulnerability: <s><br/> <s>You should know you are always at risk and it<r>s not to create any panic but just a simple acknowledgement of the fact that hackers<r> always love to pick random victims. After Anonymous came into action, the Radware report says, <a>quot;the financial sector, which had not really considered itself as a prime target, was hit and urgently forced to confront threatening situations.â€ The report also said, <a>quot;Government sites had been targeted before, but 2011 saw a dramatic increase in frequency, and neutral governments that felt themselves exempt, like New Zealand, were attacked.<a>quot; So it<r>s better adopt prevention measures rather than falling victim to Anonymous and its malicious attacks. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #2. DDoS attacks don<r>t require much activities to get launched but it<r>s really tough to get stopped: <s><br/> <s> Â  Anonymous recently boasted on Twitter that hackers from their team can easily crowdsource <a>quot;5,600 DDoS zealots blasting at onceâ€. Anonymous is highly capable of taking down a website of anyone, be it FBI or the Justice Department to the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America. Rob Rachwald, director of security strategy of Imperva, has said through an email to Information Week, <a>quot;DDoS is to the Internet what the billy club is to gang warfare: simple, cheap, unsophisticated, and effective.â€ So it<r>s better that you know to stop these attacks from the very beginning Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #3. Now you need full-proof preparation to stop these DDoS attacks: Â  <br/> <s> Â  As Asia Pacific solutions architect for Arbor Networks Roland Dobbins said in a conversation, that if attacked <a>quot;folks that don<r>t take active measures to ensure the resilience of their networks are going to get knocked over. They need to do everything they can to increase resiliency and availability.<a>quot; Roland also made a recommendation that implementing <a>quot;all of the industry best and current practices for their network infrastructure, as well as applications, critical supporting services, including DNS.<a>quot; It means proper planning can only lead to success in stopping these harmful attacks. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #4. You need to identify which part of your corporate network can become a bottleneck or the weakest link for the DDoS attack: <s><br/> <s> Â Radware conducted a survey of 135 people who posses information security expertise. The participants of this survey include IT managers, CIOs and CISOs. This survey concluded that if bottle necks are identified then 30 per cent of server attacks are done from these points, 27 per cent Internet pipes get attacked through these channels and there are several other similar instances too which prove that bottlenecks are the most vulnerable sections of any network. So first identify them and then ensure their security. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #5. You have to remain very careful about the going-on across your network: <s><br/> <s> Â  Â This is the main way to prevent attacks which will also secure the infrastructure and you can keep a check on the hackers. Actively monitor your network and as Dobbins says, <a>quot;If the enterprise doesn<r>t have visibility into their network traffic so they can exert control over the traffic, then they have a problem.â€ Watch out for any malicious possibility without any idleness. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #6. Don<r>t think that always large attacks will take place: Â  <br/> <s> Â  The most popular type of DDoS attack which is frequently used by Anonymous is a packet flood. What is does is it directs lot of packets at a website and the servers get under enormous pressure. What you need to remember is it<r>s not necessary that the attacks will be always done in conventional ways only. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #7. You need to be extra cautious about application layer-attacks: <s><br/> <s> Â  If attacks are done on a switch or any application through the packet system then it<r>s not easy to diagnose. Radware<r>s report says in this case, <a>quot;it is much easier to detect and block a network flood attack--which is about sending a large volume of irrelevant traffic such as UDP floods, SYN floods, and TCP floods, typically spoofed--rather than an application flood attack where the attackers are using real IP addresses from real machines and running complete application transactions.<a>quot; So it means your application layers can be under threat anytime and requires your attention everytime. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #8. There are a blend of attacks sometimes and you need to be extra careful for that: <s><br/> <s> Â  Â Detection of these kinds of attacks are tougher as more than one application become target at a time. Even with a packet flood all the applications can be attacked together. Radware report comments thus, <a>quot;Attackers are often likely to combine both packet flooding attacks with application-layer DDoS, to increase their odds of success. The majority of organizations, which are targeted by sub-1-Gbps attacks, are targeted with a mix of network and application flood attacks.<a>quot; So blended attacks add to the clause of your security now. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #9. You need excellent communication power and networking skills to prevent these attacks: <s><br/> <s> Â  Â Large attacks are capable of turning the largest enterprise network upside down. Dobbins solution is, <a>quot;Work very closely with [your] Internet service provider--or for multinationals, providers--to successfully deal with these attacks. At 4 a.m., if there is a DDoS attack, it<r>s not the time you want to be scrambling around trying to reconfigure your infrastructure, and finding who call at your ISP.â€ So build god relationships and communication lines before the attack even happens. Â  <br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â #10. Don<r>t always follow a single measure, adopt several ones: Â  <br/> <s> Â  Â Radware says that if you want countermeasures then a network gear may be able to mitigate suspected DDoS attacks automatically. As per the report, <a>quot;Legitimate clients generally respect this and will suspend their communication for the time being. It seems that some attackers also honor this message and suspend the attack until a new, larger window size is advertised, which of course the site being attacked has no intention of doing.<a>quot; So expand your considerations and countermeasures can help you far better.

What assurances will you get that you won<r>t be spied on, or sold down the river? The company thinks it has an answer: it just became the first big service provider to adopt a new international standard for privacy in the cloud. The guideline requires that Microsoft give its business clients (and by extension, you) guarantees about what happens to online data. It<r>ll only handle personal info according to instructions, makes it clear where that data is going, enforces strict limits on public use and promises that content won<r>t be used for ads.

But what goes around comes around: more than 50 years ago, the first hint of Higgs was inspired by the study of superconductors - a special class of metals that, when cooled to very low temperatures, allow electrons to move without resistance. <br/> <s>The discovery of the Higgs boson verified the Standard Model, which predicted that particles gain mass by passing through a field that slows down their movement through the vacuum of space. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Frydman explains that the new discovery brings the search for the Higgs boson back to its source. <a>quot;Ironically, while the discussion about this <r>missing link<r> in the Standard Model was inspired by superconductor theory, the Higgs mode was never actually observed in superconductors because of technical difficulties - difficulties that we<r>ve managed to overcome.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>According to Frydman, observation of the Higgs mechanism in superconductors is significant because it reveals how a single type of physical process behaves under drastically different energy conditions. <a>quot;Exciting the Higgs mode in a particle accelerator requires enormous energy levels - measured in giga-electronvolts, or 109 eV,<a>quot; Frydman says. <a>quot;The parallel phenomenon in superconductors occurs on a different energy scale entirely - just one-thousandth of a single electronvolt.

Itâ€™s almost like a virtual house call.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>At Hackensack, a handful of patients at risk for heart failure are asked to use a fitness tracker to count steps walked and flights climbed. They are also asked to record what they eat â€” by photographing the productâ€™s bar code, for instance â€” using a phone app that has a database containing nutrition information on thousands of food items. Using Appleâ€™s new HealthKit technology, data from the various trackers and apps gets automatically transferred to the Epic MyChart app on the iPhone. From there, the information goes to the hospitalâ€™s records system, which also comes from Epic. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Hackensack wants to expand to more patients and start tracking blood pressure and sleep quality, too. But the hospital first needs to ensure that teams are in place to review the glut of data coming in. More broadly, there are consumer privacy and security issues to address, along with questions about whether these trackers and apps really improve patient care. The University of California, San Francisco is studying which gadgets are reliable and whether that reliability extends to patients with extreme conditions. Then they have to figure out what information is really meaningful â€” not just noise. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Many doctors and hospitals see potential. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, uses Fitbit trackers to monitor hip-replacement patients for a month after surgery. Health workers get data on daily steps and can tell when patients have trouble walking â€” a hundred or more miles away. The Ochsner Health System in New Orleans is turning to wireless scales and blood-pressure devices to help reduce readmissions for chronic diseases such as heart failure. Noticing a small weight gain, for instance, might reveal fluid buildup resulting from the heart failing to pump normally. Not only can doctors intervene sooner, they can use the data to show how exercise can help lower blood pressure. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Heart-attack patients have long been asked to weigh themselves, while those with diabetes have had to check glucose levels. Smartphone technology makes all that easier and gets measurements to doctors more regularly and reliably. Thereâ€™s no forgetting to record a number or transposing digits. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>With Appleâ€™s HealthKit tools, disparate gadgets and records systems can work together more easily. Think of HealthKit as a common language, eliminating the need for translators. Beyond sleep and exercise data coming from fitness trackers, doctors can eventually incorporate devices that measure glucose, blood pressure, respiratory rates and blood-oxygen levels. The devices communicate with the iPhone wirelessly or through the headphone or charging port. Google, Samsung and Microsoft have similar ambitions that will expand monitoring to users of Android and Windows phones, though they aren<r>t as far along.

Version 2 has multiplexing, compressed headers, and can do server push. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Multiplexing: <br/> <s>Multiplexing allows clients to use a single transmission control protocol (TCP) connection instead of multiple ones.

SPDY did some things that HTTP/2 does not. It required the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) to enhance privacy and security. HTTP/2 makes this optional; it can operate over TLS or over plain TCP. Some vendors, however, have said that their implementations will only support HTTP/2 over encrypted TLS connections to regain these privacy benefits. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Browsers are well on their way toward supporting the new specification. Chrome 40 will include HTTP/2 support, with Google announcing earlier this month that SPDY support would be removed from Chrome in early 2016.

To understand how it works, we first need to take a quick historical detour to 2001 and the revolutionary breakthrough made by computer scientists Paul Viola and Michael Jones. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Viola and Jones overcame an impasse in face detection technology by ignoring the thornier issue of recognition and concentrating on spotting faces. Their algorithm looks for a light vertical line (the nose) crossed by a dark horizontal line (the eyes) in a <a>quot;detection cascade.<a>quot; This has proved very effective at recognizing faces from head-on and is incorporated into many of the digital cameras currently on the market. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The technique isn<r>t as good for spotting faces at an angle or those which are partially concealed though, which brings us back to Farfade, Saberian and Li. The team has taken a fundamentally different approach to its predecessors, employing an advanced type of machine learning known as a deep convolutional neural network. Essentially, a huge database of annotated images is used to teach the software what a face looks like. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Farfade and his colleagues have built a database containing 200,000 images of faces and 20 million images without faces. 50,000 different iterations of 128 images each were then used to train the neural network powering their detection engine. The result is a tool that can spot faces at many different angles (even upside down) and identify individual faces in a picture that contains a lot of them. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;We evaluated the proposed method with other deep learning based methods and showed that our method results in faster and more accurate results,<a>quot; say the team members, calling their creation the Deep Dense Face Detector. <a>quot;We are planning to use better sampling strategies and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques to further improve performance of the proposed method for detecting occluded and rotated faces.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As the technology filters through into consumer and commercial products, it could mean that eventually your Kinect controller and the CCTV system on your local high street are going to be able to spot you more quickly than ever.

Standard hard disk drives wonâ€™t last more than a few decades and are subject to damage from high temperatures, moisture, magnetic fields and mechanical failures. Even solid state drives, which perform better and are less susceptible to mechanical issues, will lose their data if they go unpowered for more than a few months. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>One interesting solution could be to store digital data using strands of DNA. As far-fetched as this may sound, there are a couple of very good reasons that make this an attractive proposition. Firstly, DNA can store information with a data density so high that it can be hard to fathom: a single living cell can contain millions of nucleobases and each can represent at least one bit of information, for a data density approaching one petabyte (million gigabytes) per cubic millimeter. Add to this the fact that under the right conditions fossils can preserve genetic material for millions of years, and you have the perfect candidate for long-term data storage. This is exactly what Dr. Robert Grass and team at ETH Zurich are trying to achieve. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As youâ€™ll remember from high school biology, DNA is encoded by four nucleobases, meaning that each of them can, in theory, represent up to two bits of information. After limitations dictated by the technical challenges of synthesizing and sequencing nucleotides, and with the addition of redundant bits (which make up 35 percent of total data) to protect against data corruption, the final rate is an impressive 1.2 bits of useful data for each nucleotide. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Dr. Grass and team began their experiment by storing 83 kilobytes of information (Switzerlandâ€™s Federal Charter of 1291 and Archimedeâ€™s The Methods of Mechanical Theorems) inside 4,991 DNA segments, each 158 nucleotides long. Then, to protect the DNA from degenerating over time, the researchers created a de facto <a>quot;synthetic fossil<a>quot; by encapsulating it in 150-nanometer silica spheres, which prevent the genetic material from chemically reacting with the environment. To read the data back, the nanospheres need to be exposed to a fluoride solution which dissolves the silica but leaves the DNA intact. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Digital systems designed to store data for the very long term (from high-density crystals to rugged tungsten discs) usually aim for very high levels of heat resistance. The reason for this is that the generally accepted way to estimate long-term durability and data retention in the lab is to subject the storage medium to high levels of heat. Encapsulating DNA in silica (glass) is specifically meant to provide that level of protection. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In this case, the researchers simulated the degradation of the DNA by exposing it to temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees Celsius (140â€“160 Â°F) for up to a month, which replicated the chemical degradation that would have taken place over thousands of years. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Current technology incurs a lot of mistakes while both writing and reading data from DNA, but the redundant bits written alongside the original data showed their use here. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;After storing the DNA for a simulated 10,000 years in the fridge at 4 Â°C [40 Â°F], about 80 percent of the sequences contain at least one error and about 8 percent of the sequences are completely lost,<a>quot; Grass told Gizmag. <a>quot;Still, due to the smart redundancy we have added by the Reed-Solomon coding, we are able to decode the data without final error.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The scientists calculated that if the same data had been stored at even lower temperatures, such as at the -18 Â°C (0 F) found inside the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, it would have survived for over a million years. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Although the cost of manipulating DNA makes this currently unpractical for everyday use, advances in DNA sequencing are dropping the cost of reading stored data, and more research is also going into reducing the cost of writing digital information onto genetic material. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;We are currently looking into decreasing the cost of writing information into DNA (currently at scientific level at 500 USD/MB) and into first commercial applications in storing highly valuable information,<a>quot; said Grass. <a>quot;Weâ€™re also gathering more data on the thermal stability to gain a more precise understanding on how DNA decays chemically and how this can be further avoided.<a>quot;'),

Tit-for-tat involves cooperating initially, then mimicking the other playerâ€™s last move. Thus tit-for-tat-players retaliate if defected against, but forgive a defector that starts cooperating. Once established, tit-for-tat improves productivity for all, and can become an <a>quot;evolutionarily stable strategy,<a>quot; meaning it canâ€™t be beaten by other approaches. Even with short-term incentives for defection, cooperation can thrive. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. It wasnâ€™t humanly possible to tackle game-theory problems until computers came along. But evolution has been doing game theory for millions of years â€” running trials of Darwinâ€™s â€œendless forms most beautifulâ€ with endless varieties of behavioral strategies, and naturally selecting the more productive. Species that evolved tit-for-tat can beat the productivity ceiling of selfish competition. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7. Key games in our nature, e.g., group hunting, are simpler than Prisoner<r>s Dilemmas.

Consumers claimed that Google required companies such as Samsung Electronics to favor Google apps such as YouTube on Android-powered phones, and restrict rival apps such as Microsoft<r>s Bing.

But in Friday<r>s decision, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California, said the consumers failed to show that higher prices stemmed from Google<r>s having illegally forced restrictive contracts on the handset makers.

Schools are great at theory, but not so much at practical stuff. This is especially true at the top universities. Professors are academics and are often actually hostile to more <a>quot;practical<a>quot; forms of education. The best way to be a great coder is to just practice - a lot. It doesn<r>t matter so much what you code (open source, iPhone apps, etc.) as long as you<r>re coding and pushing yourself. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#2: Be language agnostic: <br/> <s> Language is just a tool. It<r>s valuable to know a language deeply, but it<r>s also valuable to be learning new things. The best developers tend not to identify as a ____ developer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Career choices: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#3: Prestige helps: <br/> <s> Having a strong name on your resume helps open doors and show competence. If you can get a name like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Dropbox, etc, do it. (But don<r>t stay long. See #4.) <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#4: Leave the big companies quickly: <br/> <s> If you want to build your career at a big company, then by all means, stay and build your career there. But if that<r>s not what you want, leave quickly. One or two years post-college at a company like Google is great. 10 years? Not so much. You will continue to learn, but there are diminishing returns of sticking around. (Unless you want to be a big company person.) <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#5: If you want an A<an> career, come to San Francisco bay area. I love Seattle and began my career there, but I have to be honest: there are so many more opportunities in tech in the bay area. You will limit yourself as an engineer (or product manager/tech business role) if you live elsewhere. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#6: If you don<r>t want an A<an> career, don<r>t come to the bay area. It is extremely expensive here. Seriously. That<r>s worth it if you want a ton of career options. But if you just want a cushy career, there are more affordable cities with enough tech (like Seattle). A good software engineer can buy a nice house in Seattle. It<r>s a stretch in the bay area. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#7: If you don<r>t want to be a developer forever, then move on quickly. There is a lot of value in getting really deep technical expertise. But it doesn<r>t matter that much whether you spent two years as a developer or seven years. Within a few years of college graduation, make a choice. Do you want to be an engineer for the next 10, 20, 30 years or not? If you don<r>t, start trying to move on now. More time as an engineer won<r>t help you that much. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#8: Quit quickly: <br/> <s> If I look at my friends who have switches jobs, almost all of them were thinking about quitting for the last 6 - 12 months. Some stayed for 2 or 3 years after they started saying that they wanted to quit. They<r>ve wasted so much time because of just a resistance to change. If you<r>re thinking about quitting, take action now. Start applying elsewhere - or possibly just quit outright. You probably won<r>t be very successful if you<r>re unhappy anyway, and there is a big opportunity cost in staying. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Dealing with others: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#9: Integrity matters: <br/> <s> If you try to cheat and cut corners, it<r>ll haunt you. Do the right thing in life. It<r>s not only the good thing to do, but it<r>s also the smart thing to do. People will trust and like you more. More doors will open - and those doors might just be the breakthrough moments in your career. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#10: Be helpful: <br/> <s> When possible, help people who ask for help. This is a nice thing to do as well as a smart thing to do. These people who ask you for help right now will be much more likely to help you in the future. That <a>quot;help<a>quot; might be introducing you to their friends who can help you more directly. So even if you don<r>t see how that person will be helpful, you don<r>t know who their buddies are or will be. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#11: Make friends: <br/> <s> You actually can<r>t really be successful by yourself. If you<r>re an entrepreneur, you need employees and business connections. If you<r>re an employee, you need a job. Either way, it<r>s friends who will be key to opening up these opportunities. It<r>s friends, distant and close ones, who form the important part of your network, not that one person you met at a meetup and never talked to again. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Being awesome: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#12: Realize - no, internalize - that we<r>ve all got impostor syndrome. Even the most successful entrepreneurs and engineers (with very few exceptions) feel like they just got lucky and aren<r>t nearly as good as people think, and that one day soon they<r>re going to get <a>quot;caught.<a>quot; Truly internalizing just how widespread impostor syndrome is can help you realize that feeling like you<r>re a fraud doesn<r>t mean that you are. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#13: Start stuff, Show initiative: <br/> <s> Good things come to those who don<r>t wait. Seek out new opportunities. Start stuff - a hackathon, a club, a project, a company, a new running group, whatever. You will learn so much from doing this and it will open doors. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>#14: Take risks. Seize opportunities: <br/> <s>When you notice that little flicker of opportunity, seize it. Run with it. See where it goes. Don<r>t walk away just because you don<r>t know exactly where it<r>s going to go. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>#15: Bias towards <a>quot;yes.<a>quot;: <br/> <s>A great career hinges on the <a>quot;breakthrough<a>quot; moments. The problem is that you often can<r>t identify those in advance. You don<r>t know where that coffee meeting that you don<r>t see the point in is going to lead. You won<r>t know that, two months down the line, that person will end up introducing you to a guy who needs some advice and winds up as your business partner.

Having that gene is also associated with a bigger forebrain (prefrontal cortex). One in five people have that gene in their bodies. Now you must be wondering if you do as well. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Have you ever heard of the Klotho gene or Klotho protein? Well, now you have and you will be amazed of their incredible â€œsuperpowersâ€ that we are going to talk about. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The Klotho geneâ€™s function is to send signals to the brain and kidneys to create Klotho protein. It is in charge of different body functions. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Dena Dubal, MD, PhD, is an assistant professor of neurology at UCSF. Her team of researchers and her found that people who have a single copy of the KL-VS variant of the Klotho gene, produce more klotho protein than people whose bodies donâ€™t carry that gene. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Around 20% of all the people around the world are KL-VS carriers. It has been found that middle-aged and elderly people who carry the gene score better results when given cognitive tests. Also, people who have this variation of the Klotho gene show a tendency to live longer and to be protected from some diseases. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>What is more, carrying this gene is linked to smartness and increased brain function. Dubal and her team of the UCSF carried a research where they had to scan the participantsâ€™ brains in order to see if the sizes of the brainsâ€™ areas are connected to carrying one, two or no copies of the gene variation. The 422 participants in the study were men and women above the age of 53. The results showed that there is a link between the gene and the size of a particular brain area called the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC). This part of the brain is known to be considerably vulnerable to aging. It is possible that older peopleâ€™s difficulties to do more activities at once and to concentrate are linked to the aging and shrinking of that particular area. The study showed that the brains of the people who carry one copy of the gene had bigger right dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes compared to the other participants with two or none copies of the gene. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This study is a step forward to protecting people from some of the diseases connected to memory-loss and dementia. It has been known that with age peopleâ€™s cognitive abilities tend to decrease, but realizing the effects of Klotho on the human brain and body gives researchers hope for predicting brain health and finding cures for some of the worst diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s and others related to cognitive decline. <br/> <s>More information on the subject: <br/> <s>http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(14)00287-3.pdf <br/> <s>http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2015/01/122761/brain-region-vulnerable-aging-larger-those-longevity-gene-variant'),

Conventional treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy that wipe out the bulk of cancer cells don<r>t always kill cancer stem cells - a residue can survive and grow. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Residual cancer stem cells drive tumor recurrence and metastasis - where cancer spreads to other parts of the body. Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, so any treatment that prevents it will make a huge difference to patient survival. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Cancer stem cells are also thought to drive drug resistance, causing a significant problem for the effective treatment of cancer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Now, a new study suggests that graphene - a nanomaterial made of extremely thin flakes of carbon that are only one atom thick - may prove to be effective in eliminating cancer stem cells. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Reporting in the journal Oncotarget, a team from the University of Manchester in the UK led by Michael Lisanti, a professor in Manchester<r>s Institute of Cancer Sciences - describes how graphene oxide - a modified version of graphene - selectively targeted cancer stem cells in a range of cancers. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The researchers suggest their findings open the possibility of using graphene with existing treatments not only to shrink tumors but also to prevent recurrence and metastasis. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Graphene oxide flakes prevented cancer stem cells forming tumor-spheres: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The team became interested in graphene - in the form of graphene oxide - because it has shown potential as a carrier for drug delivery. The material is stable in water, and readily attaches itself to cell surfaces. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>But co-author Dr. Aravind Vijayaraghavan, of Manchester<r>s School of Materials and National Graphene Institute, says they were surprised to find that it is the graphene oxide itself that appears to be an effective anticancer drug. He explains: <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;Cancer stem cells differentiate to form a small mass of cells known as a tumor-sphere. We saw that the graphene oxide flakes prevented CSCs [cancer stem cells] from forming these, and instead forced them to differentiate into noncancer stem cells.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>However, while he and his colleagues hope these early results will lead to new cancer treatments, they also caution that there is a lot of work to do before graphene is ready for clinical trials with cancer patients. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Graphene was effective against six different cancer types: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For the study, the team tested a range of graphene oxide formulations of different flake sizes on cancer stem cells from six types of cancer: breast, pancreatic, lung, brain, ovarian and prostate. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>They used a method that is commonly used to test cancer stem cells, called the tumor-sphere assay or test. In the test, a tumor-sphere - a solid spherical, fused mass of cells - develops from a single cancer stem cell. Tumor spheres arising from cancer stem cells are easy to differentiate from clumps of other types of cell. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The researchers found the graphene oxide flakes prevented cancer stem cells from forming tumor-spheres across all six types of cancer, suggesting the method could work for a large range of cancers. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Further investigation revealed that graphene oxide prevents cancer stem cells from forming tumor-spheres by inhibiting several important signal pathways on the cells<r> surfaces. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The team suggests the results show graphene has potential use in combination therapy, helping to boost results of conventional treatments. Co-author Dr. Federica Sotgia, also of Manchester<r>s Institute of Cancer Sciences, concludes: <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;These findings show that graphene oxide could possibly be applied as a lavage or rinse during surgery to clear CSCs or as a drug targeted at CSCs.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The study builds on the pioneering work of two Manchester University physicists - Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov - who won the Nobel Prize in Physics after successfully isolating graphene from graphite in 2004. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Meanwhile, Medical News Today recently learned of another study where a team showed that camel antibodies can ferry anticancer viruses directly to tumor cells.

Did that experience inform this solar-powered flight?: <br/> <s>The balloon flight lasted 20 days, and I worried the whole time that if we didn<r>t have good winds â€“ if we didn<r>t move fast enough â€“ we would run out of fuel. When we finally landed, we had burned 3.7 tonnes of liquid propane and only had 40 kilograms left. I promised myself that the next time I flew around the world, it would be with no fuel at all.

Were you confident that you could do it?: <br/> <s>All the specialists said it was impossible to build a plane big enough for all the solar panels and batteries we would need, yet light enough to fly. But because AndrÃ© and I weren<r>t specialists, we looked for solutions outside the system.

We have the most efficient electrical motor in the world, the best insulation, a great lighting system, the lightest construction materials. And these things can now be used in cars, homes and workplaces to create a world that uses less energy. Our goal is not just to fly a solar plane around the world. We are creating, demonstrating and promoting technologies that the planet desperately needs in order to be cleaner and more sustainable. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>What factors influenced the timing and route of your flight?: <br/> <s>It is similar to the path of the balloon flight. We chose the tropical belt so we would have long days with enough sunshine, and the March start date to avoid equatorial thunderstorms. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As you and Borschberg are flying alternate legs solo, how will you rest during flights over oceans, which will take three days or more?: <br/> <s>I developed a self-hypnosis technique, where the body is asleep but the mind is alert to changes.

Spot someone at a party wearing something you like; go up and compliment them on it. Easy. But a new project called Social Textiles wants to turn fashion into a social network you can wear, alerting you when a friend is nearby, and lighting up around the like-minded to attract their attention. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This is the latest joint from MIT<r>s Tangible Media Group and Fluid Interface Group, a design team that between them has given us everything from reinvented power cords to shapeshifting displays. The Social Textiles team started with a group of MIT studentsâ€”Viirj Kan, Katsuya Fujii, Judith Amores, and Chang Long Zhu Jinâ€”who wanted to try to solve a simple problem: how can tech make social media more tangible? <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;Depending on how the ink pattern is designed, Social Textiles can communicate anything you want,<a>quot; Kan explains. <a>quot;It could tell two people who have just met that they both like jazz, or that they both go to MIT.<a>quot; Going further, it could tell two people who just met if they were a match on OKCupid, were compatible organ donors, or more. The technology that drives the T-shirt is cheap and affordable; what Social Textiles could communicate is only limited by the designer working with it. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For many, fashion is already something of a way of communicating to others that you<r>re part of a secret club. Social Textiles could take that concept to the next level, buzzing and flashing on the club floor when a like-minded club kid bumps into you. But the Social Textiles team also sees their invention being useful at more structured events like freshman meet-and-greets, company picnics, industry conferences, and so on. After all, meeting new people is hard enough. Why not let your clothes do some of the work for you? <br/> <s>Source: http://www.fastcodesign.com/3042387/mit-invents-a-social-network-you-can-wear'),

It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500 km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. . The IRNSS System is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20 metres in the primary service area. <s><br/> <s>Three satellites are to be placed in suitable orbital slots in the geostationary orbit, a circular orbit 35,786km above the equator and the remaining four will be placed in geosynchronous orbits which are elliptical orbits designed to keep communication satellites within the view of ground stations. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>The system will provide two types of services including Standard Positioning Service (SPS) which is provided to all the users and Restricted Service (RS), which is an encrypted service provided only to the authorized users.

Zuckerberg said Monday that it has launched apps with basic free services in six countries: Zambia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Colombia and most recently, India. Zuckerberg said initial feedback from telecom partners in those countries has been positive, and called the app an <a>quot;onramp<a>quot; for paid services. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;Even if they have never used Internet in their life, they have basic services they can useâ€” communication, health, education and jobsâ€” and that basically serves as an onramp so people can learn why they would want to pay for data,<a>quot; Zuckerberg said. <a>quot;And we are finding that is growing paid subscribers and overall subscribers of the Internet.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The app is customized for each country and telecom operator so as to lure new users while not hurting the telecoms<r> already existing base of customers by offering free versions of services users already pay for.

Not only does it offer a relatively new medium through which one can evaluate personality and behavior, platforms like Facebook comes stocked with loads and loads of data ripe for analysis. This leads to new research on subjects such as language analysis, mental and physical health, and cross-cultural differences. All this is according to Dr. Rick Nauert, who writes at Psych Central. Dr. Nauert covers several notable studies conducted using social media data. <s><br/> <s>For example: <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;One study, published in the journal Assessment, analyzed Facebook statuses of study participants using open-language analysis. The researchers generated word clouds that visually illustrated how several personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness) appear on Facebook. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The study found that certain phrases are predictive of specific personality traits. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For example, individuals who score high in neuroticism on a self-reported personality assessments are more likely to use words like sadness, loneliness, fear, and pain. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Researchers believe that this data may provide novel connections that may not be apparent in traditional written questionnaires and surveys.<a>quot; <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Other types of research covered by Dr. Nauert include tweet analyses that can predict physical health issues and assessments of social and gender trends by pinpointing certain choice words in captions and statuses. These results sound similar to those mentioned by Okcupid founder Christian Rudder in his Big Think interview (below) and in his book, Dataclysm. Rudder explains that this recent massive influx in data has allowed for a radical brand of objective, empirical, societal analysis on both macro and micro scales.

Although the measure isn<r>t a perfect indicator of a person<r>s overall health, it<r>s an easy way for most people to determine whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. <s><br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â Many BMI-calculating smartphone apps make the process even easier â€” and let users keep track of changes to their BMI over time. <s><br/> <s> Â  <br/> <s>Fitter Fitness Calculator: <s><br/> <s>Fitter rises to the top because it includes not only a BMI calculator, but also widgets to estimate your basal metabolic rate, body fat based on hip and forearm measurements, and waist-to-hip ratio. Taken together, these measurements offer a more holistic look at body composition than BMI alone can provide. Even better, the app includes information about each measurement and is honest about these measurements<r> limitations, such as the fact that BMI can be inaccurate in people who are very muscular. <br/> <s> Â  <br/> <s>Runner-up: <s><br/> <s>If tracking your basal metabolic rate and waist-to-hip ratio seems like overkill, a great option is BMI Calculator by Data Supply (Free, iOS). This app is simply what it says it is: an easy-to-use BMI Calculator. You can enter your height in feet and inches, centimeters, or just inches; and your weight in kilograms, pounds or stones (a unit sometimes used in the U.K.), and the app does the rest. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> Â CalculateBMI: <s><br/> <s>CalculateBMI (free, iOS), an app with the weight of a federal institution behind it. Offered by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, this app simply calculates adult BMI based on height and weight in either metric or imperial units. There is no tracking feature and no other bells and whistles, but the home screen conveniently lists the BMI scale and which numbers qualify someone as underweight, normal, overweight or obese. An information link takes you directly to the NHLBI page that explains the importance of a healthy weight â€” a very authoritative source on the topic. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> Â BMI Calculator - Weight Loss: <s><br/> <s>Android users can turn to BMI Calculator - Weight Loss (Free, Android) for a simple app that calculates your BMI, waist-to-height ratio, approximate body-fat percentage and basal metabolic rate. Each calculation appears on a screen that offers a personalized ideal number for that measurement. <br/> <s> Â  <br/> <s>myBMI: <s><br/> <s>myBMI (99 cents, iOS) is costlier than other calculators, but doesn<r>t have the annoying ads. The app allows calculations in metric and imperial units, and lets you enter your height in inches, or in feet and inches. This app also includes more detail in its BMI scale, breaking down the <a>quot;overweight<a>quot; category into four classes. These classes are linked to the risk of health problems, and the app shows how more weight brings more health risks. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> Â BMI Calculator: <s><br/> <s>Another effective option is BMI Calculator% (Free, iOS, Android). Despite the odd punctuation, this app is heavily downloaded and well-reviewed, and for good reason. The calculator is stark and simple, with no frills at all. If you<r>re looking for a plain BMI calculator, this is a good bet. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> Â BMI Calculator for Women <a>amp; Men: <s><br/> <s>In the same vein, BMI Calculator for Women <a>amp; Men (Free, iOS) is a simple, calculator-only app that won<r>t hog storage space on your phone. There is no long-term tracking, nor does the app include other features beyond the calculator. But the app is easy to use, and the bottom-of-the-screen banner ads are unobtrusive. <br/> <s> <br/> <s> Â SureBaby: <s><br/> <s>One good choice is SureBaby (Free, iOS, Android), which uses your height and pre-pregnancy weight to calculate your BMI, and thus the appropriate amount of weight to gain during pregnancy. The app takes twin pregnancies into account as well as due date, to let users know whether they<r>re on track for their particular point in gestation. Though simple, SureBaby is informative enough to include target weight ranges. The app also includes links to the SureBaby website, a pregnancy resource that includes week-by-week updates. <br/> <s> Â Read more about BMI apps: http://www.livescience.com/49981-best-bmi-calculator-apps.html'),

Divergence is the ability to generate a great quantity of ideas, to switch from one perspective to another, and to pick unusual associations of ideas. Convergence involves evaluation and choice. Creative people have the capacity to think both ways. <br/> <s>6. Both extroverted and introverted, needing people and solitude equally. <br/> <s>7. Humble and proud, both painfully self-doubting and wildly self-confident. <br/> <s>8. May defy gender stereotypes, and are likely to have not only the strengths of their own gender but those of the other as well. A kind of psychic androgyny. <br/> <s>9. Can be rebellious and independent on one hand, and traditional and conservative on the other. <br/> <s>10. A natural openness and sensitivity that often exposes them to extreme suffering and pain, yet also to a great deal of enjoyment. Despair alternates with bliss, despair when they arenâ€™t working, and bliss when they are. <br/> <s>The most important quality among creative people, says Csikszentmilhalyi, is the ability to enjoy the process of creation for its own sake. <br/> <s>Ask yourself how you can create classrooms, workplaces, families, and healing environments that value and support the gifts that the creative people you know have to offer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Read more at http://expandedconsciousness.com/2015/02/17/10-paradoxical-traits-highly-creative-people'),

Text segment <br/> <s>2. Initialized data segment <br/> <s>3. Uninitialized data segment <br/> <s>4. Stack <br/> <s>5. Heap <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. Text Segment: <br/> <s>A text segment , also known as a code segment or simply as text, is one of the sections of a program in an object file or in memory, which contains executable instructions. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As a memory region, a text segment may be placed below the heap or stack in order to prevent heaps and stack overflows from overwriting it. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Usually, the text segment is sharable so that only a single copy needs to be in memory for frequently executed programs, such as text editors, the C compiler, the shells, and so on. Also, the text segment is often read-only, to prevent a program from accidentally modifying its instructions. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Initialized Data Segment: <br/> <s>Initialized data segment, usually called simply the Data Segment. A data segment is a portion of virtual address space of a program, which contains the global variables and static variables that are initialized by the programmer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Note that, data segment is not read-only, since the values of the variables can be altered at run time. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This segment can be further classified into initialized read-only area and initialized read-write area. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For instance the global string defined by char s[] = â€œhello worldâ€ in C and a C statement like int debug=1 outside the main (i.e. global) would be stored in initialized read-write area. And a global C statement like const char* string = â€œhello worldâ€ makes the string literal â€œhello worldâ€ to be stored in initialized read-only area and the character pointer variable string in initialized read-write area. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Ex: static int i = 10 will be stored in data segment and global int i = 10 will also be stored in data segment <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Uninitialized Data Segment: <br/> <s>Uninitialized data segment, often called the â€œbssâ€ segment, named after an ancient assembler operator that stood for â€œblock started by symbol.â€ Data in this segment is initialized by the kernel to arithmetic 0 before the program starts executing <br/> <s> <br/> <s>uninitialized data starts at the end of the data segment and contains all global variables and static variables that are initialized to zero or do not have explicit initialization in source code. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For instance a variable declared static int i; would be contained in the BSS segment. <br/> <s>For instance a global variable declared int j; would be contained in the BSS segment. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Stack: <br/> <s>The stack area traditionally adjoined the heap area and grew the opposite direction; when the stack pointer met the heap pointer, free memory was exhausted. (With modern large address spaces and virtual memory techniques they may be placed almost anywhere, but they still typically grow opposite directions.) <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The stack area contains the program stack, a LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts of memory. On the standard PC x86 computer architecture it grows toward address zero; on some other architectures it grows the opposite direction. A â€œstack pointerâ€ register tracks the top of the stack; it is adjusted each time a value is â€œpushedâ€ onto the stack. The set of values pushed for one function call is termed a â€œstack frameâ€; A stack frame consists at minimum of a return address. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Stack, where automatic variables are stored, along with information that is saved each time a function is called. Each time a function is called, the address of where to return to and certain information about the callerâ€™s environment, such as some of the machine registers, are saved on the stack. The newly called function then allocates room on the stack for its automatic and temporary variables. This is how recursive functions in C can work. Each time a recursive function calls itself, a new stack frame is used, so one set of variables doesnâ€™t interfere with the variables from another instance of the function. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. Heap: <br/> <s>Heap is the segment where dynamic memory allocation usually takes place. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The heap area begins at the end of the BSS segment and grows to larger addresses from there.The Heap area is managed by malloc, realloc, and free, which may use the brk and sbrk system calls to adjust its size (note that the use of brk/sbrk and a single â€œheap areaâ€ is not required to fulfill the contract of malloc/realloc/free; they may also be implemented using mmap to reserve potentially non-contiguous regions of virtual memory into the processâ€™ virtual address space). The Heap area is shared by all shared libraries and dynamically loaded modules in a process.');

After observing Glassnerâ€™s seemingly miraculous healings, Mesmer concluded that the cures were achieved by what he called â€œanimal magnetism.â€ Mesmer believed that invisible magnetic fluids existed in living beings, and that if this invisible magnetic flow was upset, sickness could occur.

The result is a palm-sized device called LifePhonePlus. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The device allows people to take an ECG, monitor their blood-glucose levels and seek a specialistâ€™s advice without traveling anywhere. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The LifePhonePlus first became available in 2013. Ranganathan said doctors at several clinics and hospitals currently offer diagnoses to people who use it. Last year the device won the South Asia E-Health Summit Award for mobile health innovation. <br/> <s>See full specs and description about LifePhonePlus: http://bplmedicaltechnologies.com/lifephoneplus/ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Indian telecommunications companies have developed mobile plans that allow customers to pay only when they can afford to, an approach that has allowed some 900 million Indians to use cell phones. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Widespread mobile access is one of the things that makes the LifePhonePlus possible. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>According to government data, one in 25 Indians die from heart failure due to coronary heart disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and rheumatic heart disease. Rather than increasing the number of doctors in rural areas, one way to cope with this problem is to help people become more aware of their health conditions. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The LifePhonePlus uses Bluetooth or WiFi wireless technologies to send the health information it collects to the userâ€™s phone and then on to a doctor. The doctor then sends back advice, which might range from cutting down on sweets to go to a hospital as soon as possible.'),

It has one of the most steepest learning curve. Unless and until the concepts are clear in your head, you cannot proceed with the programming a market level app or software. There are few easy ways to accelerate the learning process of programming. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Practising something is the best way to proceed with developing the programming skillset. Unless and until you try programming few apps, you would not get the clear idea of programming a market-ready app. Today we have listed 5 such project ideas that can accelerate the learning curve of programming. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. Create A Web or Mobile App: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Coding a web app or mobile app is one of the popular programming form in todayâ€™s world. There are number of web programming languages and modules available to code the web or mobile app. You can make use of existing frameworks and SDKs to code your first web or mobile app. You should definitely consider coding the web app that serves some real purpose. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>A mobile technology varies from OS to OS. The development environment and programming languges for Android, iOS and Windows Phone may differ but at the end of the day, the learning curve of developing mobile app remains the same. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Browser Extension: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>This is similar to creating web or mobile app as it requires you to know more or less same programming language. Web browser based tools are proven very helpful. This is a great supplementary experience to your programming learning experience. There are number of in house editors available in Chrome store that you can use to develop your first browser extension. You can always code a browser extension for some specific browser and then port the same to support other web browsers. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Video Game: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Game development is unique segment as it involves you to master in fundamental concepts of programming and designing. This is lot different than what you do in web development or business software. The game development tools are wide and can really help you with the development process. Newbies can use some tutorials and put their game idea in an app. We would suggest you to learn Unity Engine which is a user friendly game development environment for mobile platforms. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Open Source: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>One of the best ways to improve your programming skill set is to development something to contribute to open source. You can start open source project of your own and get opinions on that from wide network of open source communities. You can study and learn from it, the submitted code can be improved. You can expand your network of coding friends and mentors. The best part of open source project is you donâ€™t have to deal with all the pressure, you can always find some contributors to help you out online. Open source communities are huge. You should be careful while choosing the open source platform while starting with open source project development. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. Coding Jams: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Who doesnâ€™t like competitions? Competition is healthy and teaches you lot of new things. You should lookout for a coding jam or hackathon. There are number of competitions that happen around you every month. These coding jams force you to grow and adapt logical thinking in minimum time. You can either look for some local hackathon or coding jam happening in your city or you can participate in some online coding contest like Google Code Jam, CodeChef competitions or Project Euler. <br/> <s>From http://azure.efytimes.com/?p=498'),

Under connectivity, it offers the usual GPS, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi and NFC. The main highlight in connectivity is that the phone has an LTE support. All these facilities naturally require the phone to have a great battery life which it is expected to have considering the huge battery size of 3600 mAh. The user can buy either the dual-sim or the single-sim variant of the phone. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The phone has already begun its sales in China. According to Indian currency, the dual-sim phone approximately costs Rs 25000 and the single-sim phone costs Rs 20000 in the markets of China. It is expected that the prices of the phone will be similar to those in the Chinese markets. The exact date of availability is yet unknown but there are strong rumours which suggest that the phone will become available by the end of March.');

The Dutch fashionista Anouk Wipprecht designs robotic evening wear that gives a technophilic twist to the world of catwalks and haute couture. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Her latest Spider Dress â€” in collaboration with architect Philip H. Wilck of Studio Palermo â€” is a somewhat menacing cocktail dress with a kick, inspired by many things, including the world of games. Rather than someplace like the New York Fashion Show, this tech-infused Spider Dress made its public debut at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. <br/> <s>Unique, stunning and often startling, her futuristic garments range from halter tops that emit plumes of smoke to metal-plated mail that attracts Tesla coil discharge. In a day and age where the trend in wearable tech is to make it invisible, she puts the internal computations on center stage with purple bolts of electricity zapping out. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Once you put clothing with feedback sensors on your body, something as simple as wearing a flannel shirt becomes an exercise in onboard interface. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>True to its name, the outfit features six creepy-crawly mechanical arms. They are actually inspired by the infamous spider sequence in the puzzle platforming game Limbo. Created by Danish game maker Play Dead, <s><br/> <s>The game-over screen when this thing kills you is every bit as ghastly as her description, too. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Unlike those lethal legs, Spider Dress will not leave a dead body on the barstool next to you, because that would be murder. It does, however, take cues from Limboâ€™s spirit of play. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>A good example is her fashion piece Synapse, a dress that has super-villain shoulder guards and a cocoon-like chest plate or â€œshieldâ€ that pulses with indigo light. <br/> <s>The dress relies on a headpiece exchanging signals with an Intel Edison module to read its wearerâ€™s biorhythms. With this data, it knows which people the wearer likes and dislikes. It can lure a standoffish visitor closer with an inviting twinkle, and its light system also knows to blind a close-talker with a 120-watt flash. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Much of Wipprechtâ€™s art has to do with the theme of physical space between people, or other peopleâ€™s territory, as she puts it. The â€œdangerous and pointyâ€ appearance of her dresses, for instance, heightens the â€œpsychological thrillâ€ of social interactions, but a large part of the experience is personal, too. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>She alludes to the intimate feeling of hearing the raw sound of little motors spin, or seeing the light frequencies flicker in a pattern when you feel, say, aroused. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>â€œI like the notion that my systems are protective, that they empower the wearer, but they also question the entity they are hosted on,â€ she said. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>â€œWhen you wear a design that you are partly in control of and that partly controls you â€” or that is partly controlled by your surroundings and partly controlled by your subconscious,â€ she clarifies, â€œyou start to question where you end and my system begins.â€ <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In that light, strapping into one of Wipprechtâ€™s systems sounds a little â€” okay, very â€” intimidating. After all, you are handing over your inner thoughts and feelings to a pair of creepy robot-spider appendages that can and will lash out at those in your vicinity, depending on your stress amounts. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Whatâ€™s more, with the ability to read bio-signals such as heartbeat, brain activity and distraction levels, the Synapse â€œsometimes knows you better than you know yourself,â€ she said. <br/> <s>Thereâ€™s no getting around it. Your emotional states are decoded into a sequence of flashing lights for the whole world to see. With that in mind, it seems Wipprechtâ€™s projects externalize not only the processes of machines, but also the functions of a living human brain, whether you like it or not. <br/> <s>Via https://iq.intel.com/gaming-plays-role-designing-interactive-wearables/'),

Research like this paves the way for electronics that could go into clothes or other wearables that people could comfortably tote around all day. <br/> <s>One especially cool aspect of the armband is that its power-supply circuit incorporates carbon-based organic components. Such organic electronics arenâ€™t as efficient as classic electronics made with metals and silicon. Researchers are interested in them, however, because they can have other helpful properties. They can bend and stretch, which you would want in an armband that a person has to wear. They work better with unusual materials, such as the flexible plastic that makes up the backing on the armband. Organic electronics can also be cheap and easy to manufacture.

By building a dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitterâ€˜s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that â€œjust worksâ€. You donâ€™t need to build an audience, promote your stream, or keep track of comments. It all happens automatically through Twitter. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Meerkatâ€™s app has a rough-shod charm reminiscent of Snapchat. Bugs make comments glitch out, push notifications fail to open, streams to drop, and videos not to record. Because tweets last forever, but streams can often be short, Meerkat links on Twitter often lead to dead-ends. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Still, Meerkat is succeeding. Itâ€™s received rave reviews on Product Hunt, signed up droves of techâ€™s elite, and seen usage for everything from intellectual discussions to art gallery tours, pets and sunsets to hour-long filibusters I donâ€™t regret. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>It might not be the perfect product, but the app is developing invaluable critical mass and network effect. Meerkat has become the proprietary eponym of mobile live video broadcasting. The Kleenex. The Xerox. Anyone else trying to break into the market will do so in Meerkatâ€™s shadow, and have to prove why theyâ€™re exponentially better, not just an incremental improvement. <br/> <s>Read more http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/the-inevitable-democratization/'),

Yes, itâ€™s a bold statement to make, but as data gathering and analysis grow in marketing practices (and become more and more a requirement by our CEOs), the value of data is quickly surpassing that of traditional marketing capabilities. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Now, let me take a step back. We have all seen an explosion in data growth and availability over the last few years. But the question that remains is: How can we process and act on all of this information? <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The answer is four-fold: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. Modern Marketing = Data: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>CMOs have come to realize that access to data poses endless possibilities. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s paramount that CMOs employ a strong data analytics team to accurately make sense of this influx in figures. This year, CMOs will need to recruit team members with pure data and analytics backgrounds â€” data scientists, statisticians, data operations, and machine learning â€” and have an innate understanding of A/B testing, modeling and analytics. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Real Time Begets ROI: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The 2015 CMO needs to understand trending topics in real time and be positioned to immediately react. Accurate, instantaneous forecasts will be the primary source to optimize interactions. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Think about it: the marketing office will look like a trading room floor with screens streaming with data on leads, campaign performance, web activity, open rates, etc. If CMOs and their marketing teams donâ€™t have that level of access, they are already starting off the year behind. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Content Remains King: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>As content consumption continues to increase across all modes of technology, clever CMOs understand the need to use content analytics to measure engagement and inbound traffic. The ability to measure and analyze video and other content consumption will provide a solid foundation for producing future content. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Once CMOs and their marketing teams have robust data on how their target audiences interact with videos, blog posts, white papers and more, they can create content that is tailored to each specific customer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. The Digital Now, Digital First Reality: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Today, we spread our attention over a host of different digital mediums. Savvy CMOs will need to shift toward digital engagement to find the best strategies to reach customers based on analysis from their team of data scientists. For customers that have a history of viewing particular content from their mobile devices or from social channels, marketing teams will be able to offer them a unique experience with content that they will enjoy, value and share. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Put simply, traditional marketing as we know it is dead. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>In order to stay relevant and drive true ROI for their companies, CMOs have to build a marketing team and establish processes that prioritize data and analytics. Itâ€™s time to forge ahead further into the world of big data and real time analytics and channel it into interactions that make true impact â€” with more precise targeting, personalization and engagement. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>After all, it may be the year of the predictive marketer, but weâ€™re living in the age of the customer. And they know exactly what they want, when they want it. The sooner we embrace that and shift when they shift, the sooner weâ€™ll see true ROI on our marketing efforts. <br/> <s>Via http://www.cmswire.com/cms/digital-marketing/the-year-of-the-predictive-marketer-028341.php'),

The most difficult aspect involved in building a library of test cases is determining which test cases to include. The most common suggestion from authorities in the field of software testing is to avoid spending excessive amounts of time trying to decide and err on the side of caution. Automated tests, as well as test cases involving boundary conditions and timing almost definitely belong in your library. <s> <br/> <s> <br/> <s> Â Example regression testing tools are: <s><br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â Winrunner: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1215990 <s><br/> <s> Â QTP: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1215990#.VP7EXXyUeyk <s><br/> <s> Â AdventNet QEngine: http://www.adventnet.com/products/qengine/index.html <s><br/> <s> Â Regression Tester: http://www.regressiontester.com/ <s><br/> <s> Â vTest: http://www.verisium.com/products/vTest/index.html <s><br/> <s> Â Watir and Selenium <s><br/> <s> Â Rational Functional Tester: http://www.ibm.com/products/us/en/ <s><br/> <s> Â SilkTest: http://www.borland.com/Home <s><br/> <s> Â  <s><br/> <s> Â Most of these tools are both functional and regression test tools. Adding and updating regression test cases in automation test suite is cumbersome task. While selecting automation tool for regression tests, you should check if the tool allows you to add or update the test cases easily.

And especially, if you<r>re looking forward to making a career in Google, then you need to be extra careful. More than around 50,000 resumes are received by Google every week and the company<r>s senior VP Laszlo Bock personally checks more than 20,000 among them. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Now Bock has decided to help out job seekers by pointing out basic 5 mistakes, which are committed most frequently. He has also provided solutions to keep a check on every mistake. For the same purpose, Bock has shared the mistake list on his LinkedIn page. This help will aid you in longer run, even if Google is not your destination. So try to avoid these mistakes while looking for a job. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. Typos: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Typos, including spelling and punctuation mistakes, are quite frequent in resumes, as per Bock. To avoid these kind of mistakes, which are pretty silly ones, Bock has a suggestion. Bock says every resume should be perused thoroughly with more focus between the lines. Bock thinks that typos can be deadly as for employers this kind of error looks like lack of concentration and lack of maintaining quality work. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. Length: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>None of the resumes should be two-pages long as in just one page too, ten years<r> experience can be included, as per Bock. So Bock makes it very clear that a resume has just one objective, to get selected for an interview. It<r>s not meant to persuade any employer to hire you and a long resume can actually test the employer<r>s patience, as Bock says. So the resume should be precise and more focused on the most relevant information of your career and academics so far. If your resume has this quality, then it signifies that you<r>re able to prioritise things in your life. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3. Complicated formatting: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>The resume should be clean and readable, not at all stylish. So you can skip the artistic fonts in your resume. Bock has come out with some basic good rules like the font should be kept at 10 and half-inch margins should be left in your resume. Some other key features for a good resume are proper spacing and correct personal information. Your resume should always be a white paper with black writing. The best format for a resume is PDF, otherwise the second option is MS Word and Google Docs. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>4. Revealing confidential company information: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>If you reveal any secret information of your present organisation in your resume, it means you<r>ll do the same with Google or any new company too. Bock writes that a conflict is always there between an employer<r>s requirements and your own needs. Bock also shared an example of a resume which he received with some confidential information. This mistake should be strictly avoided to stay in good books of any new employer. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>5. Telling outright lies: <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>Never say any lie in your resume, Bock suggests. Some people may be tempted to overstate about their job responsibilities and experiences but this is not a very healthy sign on your resume. Bock points out that reference checks and also Google searches can reveal the ultimate truth which can actually land your job at great trouble. And then Bock referred to our respectable mothers who have sincerely taught us that saying lies is not a very ethical thing.'),

This move from BMW Motorrad comes at a time when Ducati seems to be planning very aggressive pricing for a few of its bike models. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The F700 GS is powered by a water cooled twin cylinder engine.

A top speed of 191 Kmph means that this bike will have more than adequate performance on all roads. Fuel efficiency is another strength. BMW claims that the F700 GS will return a mileage of 25.5 Kmpl when ridden at nearly 90 Kmph.

The upper layer, which is more prominent in males than in females and juveniles, can change color by changing its structure and how it reflects lights, researchers said. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>The lizards<r> cells undergo structural changes that affect how light reflects off their skin. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The chameleon<r>s uncanny ability to change color has long mystified people, but now the lizard<r>s secret is out: Chameleons can rapidly change color by adjusting a layer of special cells nestled within their skin, a new study finds. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Unlike other animals that change color, such as the squid and octopus, chameleons do not modify their hues by accumulating or dispersing pigments within their skin cells, the researchers found. Instead, the lizards rely on structural changes that affect how light reflects off their skin, the researchers said. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>To investigate how the reptiles change color, researchers studied five adult male, four adult female and four juvenile panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis), a type of lizard that lives in Madagascar. The scientists found that the chameleons had two superposed thick layers of iridophore cells â€” iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light. [See photos of color-changing chameleons] <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The iridophore cells contain nanocrystalsof different sizes, shapes and organizations, which are key to the chameleons<r> dramatic color shifts, the researchers said. The chameleons can change the structural arrangement of the upper cell layer by relaxing or exciting the skin, which leads to a change in color, they found. For instance, a male chameleon might be in a relaxed state when it<r>s hanging out on a branch, and in an excited state when it sees a rival male. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;When the skin is in the relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the iridophore cells are very close to each other â€” hence, the cells specifically reflect short wavelengths, such as blue,<a>quot; said study senior author Michel Milinkovitch, a professor of genetics and evolution at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>On the other hand, when the skin becomes excited, the distance between neighboring nanocrystals increases, and each iridophore cell (which contains these nanocrystals) selectively reflects longer wavelengths, such as yellow, orange or red, Milinkovitch told Live Science in an email.But chameleons aren<r>t always blue. The lizards<r> skin also contains yellow pigments, and blue mixed with yellow makes green, a <a>quot;cryptic<a>quot; color that camouflages them among trees and plants, Milinkovitch said. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The <a>quot;red skin hue does not change dramatically during excitation, but its brightness increases,<a>quot; the researchers wrote in the study. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Furthermore, the researchers found a deeper and thicker layer of skin cells that reflect a large amount of near-infrared sunlight. While these cells do not appear to change color, it<r>s possible that they help the chameleons reflect heat and stay cool, the researchers said. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The researchers used a number of methods to study the iridophore cells. They filmed the chameleons<r> color changes using high-resolution videography and made numerical models that predict how the nanocrystals should reflect light. <br/> <s> <br/> <s><a>quot;The results are a perfect match with what we observe [in real life],<a>quot; Milinkovitch said. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The researchers also manipulated the cells by subjecting them to solutions of varying concentrations, which caused the cells to swell or shrink. These modifications changed the distances between the nanocrystals, and altered their visible colors, just as the researchers predicted they would, Milinkovitch said. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>However, only adult male chameleons change color, especially when they see a rival male chameleon they want to chase away, or a female to attract, Milinkovitch said. Females and young chameleons are dull-colored and have a very reduced upper layer of iridophore cells, he said. <br/> <s>References: http://phys.org/news/2013-05-chameleons-creatures-colour.html and http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-secret-to-chameleons-ability-to-change-color/'),

While it is important to learn basic math, science, and reading to survive in todayâ€™s world, it is also important to teach kids how to thrive. <br/> <s>With some slight adjustments, we could quickly start to improve education by adding a few new subjects aimed at helping kids become healthy and successful adults. <s><br/> <s> <br/> <s>1) Meditation: <br/> <s><a>quot;If every 8 year old is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence from the world in one generation<a>quot;: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Meditation clears out the clutter of anxious thoughts, helps people focus, and increases mental (and physical) health.

Theyâ€™d start their morning centered and peaceful rather than rushed and scattered. I would imagine this would have tremendous effects on learning gains as well as behavior. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2) Proper Nutrition: <br/> <s>Why arenâ€™t schools teaching our children how to take care of their bodies?: <br/> <s>The thing is that kids already learn about nutrition in school, so we donâ€™t have to completely overhaul the system to fit in new courses on nutrition. We just need to start being honest with them about whatâ€™s really going on with our food. Letâ€™s be serious: 20 years from now, proper nutritional education (or the lack thereof) will have a much more profound impact on the lives of young people than Algebra 2 will. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>3) Law of Attraction: <br/> <s>From a very young age, we have had it beaten into us that there are rules we must follow and a very specific path we must walk down if we want to be successful. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Many of us buy into the idea that we must go to college (usually by taking on massive loans), and get an acceptable job (like being a doctor, accountant or a lawyer) if we want to be successful in life. This rigid thinking sways many young people away from exploring their true passions. <br/> <s>Teaching students about the Law of Attraction from an early age would give kids the tools they need to go after their big dreams and live fulfilling lives.

The new holy grail is unifying communications: to get your phone to talk to your computer, so you can view and respond to things like text messages and phone calls on any device. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For example, while writing this column in the Google Chrome browser, using Google Docs, I tapped the home button to turn on my iPhone screen. At the bottom of the screen, in the left corner, there was a little browser icon. When I tapped the icon and swiped up, the phone automatically opened a browser window that brought up the very Google Doc I was working on. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>An even more useful example is navigation. If I use Safari to search for directions and open them in Apple Maps on the computer, a Maps icon will pop up on the phone. When I swipe up on that icon, I see the directions on the phone. <br/> <s>The combination of Gmail, the Chrome browser and the Google Hangouts app will let you see and sync email and open tabs, directions and messages on your phone, tablet or computer â€” even if some of those devices are made by Apple or another company. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Unfortunately, as with many Google solutions, it takes some doing to get it all working. For example, you can make voice calls from within Gmail at no charge using the Google Plus Hangouts app, but only to other Hangouts users. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>The Hangouts app works on Macs, PCs, iPhones, Android phones and other phones as well. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Google also offers an extension for Chrome called Chrome to Phone (not the same as an older extension called Chrome to Mobile, which has apparently been disabled) that will let you send links to web pages, phone numbers or directions from the browser to your phone with one click. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>You can also sync Chromeâ€™s browser tabs between a computer and the mobile version of Chrome on either iOS or Android â€” just enable it in Chromeâ€™s settings under Advanced Sync Settings. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>For more Example http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/technology/personaltech/device-syncing-call-from-computers-and-text-from-tablets.html'),

This Chinese company has confirmed yesterday that they will re-announce the Redmi 2 in India, the companyâ€™s mid-ranger which was originally showcased back in January. Well, the device has been officially announced during the event Xiaomi held in India. As you probably already know, there are two version of the Redmi 2 available in China, the 1GB of RAM version which ships with 8GB of internal storage, and the 2GB of RAM variant which comes with 16GB of internal storage. Both of these variants offers microSD card expansion though, and it seems like Xiaomi decided to announce only the 1GB version in India (the 2GB version will arrive later on). <br/> <s>See full specs http://smartmobtech.com/mobile/xiaomi-redmi-2-price-specs/'),

Turns out that people arenâ€™t very good at thinking about two things at once. One study showed that when people were interrupted to respond to email or IM, it took about 15 minutes for them to resume a serious mental task. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>So consider taking steps like these, at least occasionally. They may not all work for you, but you may find a few that will help you focus. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>1. If you keep the TV, radio, or music turned on in the background: <br/> <s> while youâ€™re getting dressed, say â€“ turn it off. Some people love background noise, but I find it very draining. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>2. I have a sticky note in my bedroom that reads, â€œQuiet mind.â€: <br/> <s> Whenever I see it, I drop my shoulders, relax my jaw, and try to smooth out my thoughts.

Turn your cell phone ringer off: <br/> <s> Hearing your cell phone ring â€“ or even imagining that youâ€™re hearing it ring â€“ is a big source of jumpiness. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>6. Take a break from doing errands: <br/> <s> Keep a list, but donâ€™t try to cram them in throughout your day. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>7.

Turn off your email for some parts of the day: <br/> <s> <br/> <s>9. Stop counting: <br/> <s> In her book The Creative Habit, Twyla Tharp mentioned an interesting approach: occasionally, for a week, sheâ€™d â€œstop counting.â€ She avoided looking at clocks, contracts, bank statements, bathroom scales, or anything to do with numbers, in order to let the other part of her brain take over. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>10.

So when I have serious writing to do, I go to a library near my apartment which has a study room with a strict rule of silence. <br/> <s> <br/> <s>Itâ€™s important to have space in which to think.

Itâ€™s almost like a hot glue gun, but with fine lines of plastic instead of glue, allowing you to craft three-dimensional objects in space without the need for blueprints, or the exorbitant cost of a 3D printer. The 3Doodler 2.0 also touts dual speeds and a slimmer, lighter profile than its predecessor.
